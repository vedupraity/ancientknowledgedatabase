From Lord Shiva’s matted hair flows the holy river, Ganga consecrating His neck, From His neck hangs the serpent like a garland, From His damaru (percussion instrument) comes the damad-damad-damad sound filling the air, Lord Shiva performs His passionate Tandava dance; may the Lord bless us all!

As the rows of waves of the sacred Ganga move through Lord Shiva’s matted hair, it glorifies His Head, The waves of the river flow into the depths of His locks of hair, A brilliant fire burns on the surface of Lord Shiva’s forehead, And the crescent moon is a jewel on His Head. (May we find constant joy in Him!)

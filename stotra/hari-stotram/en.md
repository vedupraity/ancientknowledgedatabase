I worship and worship him,
Who is the protector of the world,

I worship and worship him,
Who is the garland in the neck of Lakshmi,

Who has a form which attracts the mind,
And who has assumed several forms.

Who is not interested in anything,
Who carried the Govardhana Mountain,
Who is pure music to great sages,
Who is served by Devas,
And who is above all beings.

#### Phalaśruti (Outcome)

##### idam yastu nityaṃ samādhāya cittam paṭhedaṣṭakam kaṇṭhahāraṃ murāreḥ .
##### sa viṣṇorviśokaṃ dhruvam yāti lokam jarājanma śokaṃ punarvidante no ..

The one who reads with peace,
This octet on Hari,
Which is the destroyer of sorrow,
Would definitely reach the world of Vishnu,
Which is always without sorrow,
And he would never undergo sorrow ever.

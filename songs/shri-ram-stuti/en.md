#### Dohā

##### śrī rāmacandra kṛpālu bhajumana haraṇa bhavabhaya dāruṇaṃ .
##### nava kaṃja locana kaṃja mukha kara kaṃja pada kaṃjāruṇaṃ .. 1 ..

O mind! Revere the benign Shri Ramachandra, who removes 'Bhava' the worldly sorrow or pain, 'Bhaya' the fear, and 'Daruna' the scarcity or poverty.

Who has fresh lotus eyes, lotus face and lotus hands, feet like lotus and like the rising sun. ॥1॥

##### kandarpa agaṇita amita chavi nava nīla nīrada sundaraṃ .
##### paṭapīta mānahum̐ taḍita ruci śuci nomi janaka sutāvaraṃ .. 2 ..

His beauty exceeds innumerable Kaamdevs (Cupids). He is like a newly formed beautiful blue cloud. The yellow robe on his body appears like delightful lighting.

He is the consort of the daughter of Sri Janak (Sri Sita), the embodiment of sacredness.॥2॥

##### bhaju dīnabandhu dineśa dānava daitya vaṃśa nikandanaṃ .
##### raghunanda ānanda kanda kośala canda daśaratha nandanaṃ .. 3 ..

O mind, sing praises of Sri Ram, a friend of the poor. He is the lord of the solar dynasty. He is the destroyer of demons and devils.

The descendant of Sri Raghu is the source of joy, a moon of his mother Kaushalya and he is the son of Sri Dashrath.॥3॥

##### śira mukuṭa kuṃḍala tilaka cāru udāru aṅga vibhūṣaṇaṃ .
##### ājānu bhuja śara cāpa dhara saṃgrāma jita kharadūṣaṇaṃ .. 4 ..

He wears a crown on his head, pendants on his ear, and tilak (crimson mark) on his forehead. All his organs are beautiful and well decorated with ornaments.

His arms reach his knees. He holds a bow and an arrow. He emerged victorious in the battle with demons Khar and Dushan.॥4॥

##### iti vadati tulasīdāsa śaṃkara śeṣa muni mana raṃjanaṃ .
##### mam hṛdaya kaṃja nivāsa kuru kāmādi khaladala gaṃjanaṃ .. 5 ..

Thus says Sri Tulsidas – O Sri Ram, the charmer of Lord Shiv, Sri Shesh and saints,

reside in the lotus of my heart and destroy all the evils and their associates like desires.॥5॥

##### mana jāhi rācyo milahi so vara sahaja sundara sāṃvaro .
##### karuṇā nidhāna sujāna śīla sneha jānata rāvaro .. 6 ..

Goddess Gauri says to Goddess Sita in answer to her prayers made to Gauri : "In whom your mind is enamored, you will get the same dusky bridegroom Lord Ram as your husband. He is so merciful (treasure of mercy) and omniscient. He is aware of your modesty and love."

##### ehi bhāṃti gaurī asīsa suna siya sahita hiya haraṣita alī .
##### tulasī bhavānihi pūjī puni-puni mudita mana mandira calī .. 7 ..

Thus hearing the blessings of Goddess Gauri in this way all the friends including Goddess Janki became happy in heart.

#### Soraṭhā

##### jānī gaurī anukūla siya hiya haraṣu na jāi kahi .
##### maṃjula maṃgala mūla vāma aṅga pharakana lage .

Tulsidas says, worshipping Goddess Gauri again and again Goddess Sita returned to palace happily.

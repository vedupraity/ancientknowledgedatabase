#### Dialogue between Śrī Rāma, Kausalyā and Sītā

#### Dohas

##### bahuri baccha kahi lālu kahi raghupati raghubara tāta.
##### kabahiṃ bōlāi lagāi hiyaom haraṣi nirakhihau gāta..68.. [2-68]

When again shall I call you 'my darling', 'my pet child', 'O Lord of Raghus', 'O Chief of Raghu's race', 'my boy', and summoning you clasp you to my bosom and gaze upon your limbs with delight?

##### lakhi sanēha kātari mahatārī. bacanu na āva bikala bhai bhārī..
##### rāma prabōdhu kīnha bidhi nānā. samau sanēhu na jāi bakhānā.. [2-68-1]
##### taba jānakī sāsu paga lāgī. sunia māya maiṃ parama abhāgī..
##### sēvā samaya daiaom banu dīnhā. mōra manōrathu saphala na kīnhā.. [2-68-2]
##### tajaba chōbhu jani chāḍaia chōhū. karamu kaṭhina kachu dōsu na mōhū..
##### suni siya bacana sāsu akulānī. dasā kavani bidhi kahauṃ bakhānī.. [2-68-3]
##### bārahi bāra lāi ura līnhī. dhari dhīraju sikha āsiṣa dīnhī..
##### acala hōu ahivātu tumhārā. jaba lagi gaṃga jamuna jala dhārā.. [2-68-4]

Seeing that His mother was too overwhelmed with emotion to speak any more and was greatly agitated, Śrī Rāma consoled her in various ways; the gravity of the occasion and the intensity of affection was more than one could describe. Janaka's Daughter then threw Herself at Her mother-in-law's feet and said, "I tell you, mother: I am most unluckly in that at a time when I should have served you heaven has exiled me to the forest and has refused to grant my desire. Pray be not perturbed any more but at the same time cease not to entertain kindly feelings towards me. Relentless is fate and there is no fault of mine either." The mother-in-law was so distressed to hear Sītā's words that I have no words to describe her condition. Again and again she pressed her Daughter-in-law to her breast and recovering herself admonished and blessed Her: "May the blessed state of your wifehood (the longevity of your husband) know no break and endure so long as the streams of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā continue to flow."

#### Dohas

##### sītahi sāsu asīsa sikha dīnhi anēka prakāra.
##### calī nāi pada paduma siru ati hita bārahiṃ bāra..69.. [2-69]

The mother-in-law blessed and admonished Sītā in various ways and the latter parted from her, most affectionately bowing Her head at her lotus feet again and again.

### Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā call on king Daśaratha to take leave of him; Daśaratha's advice to Sītā

### Dohas

#### sīya sahita suta subhaga dōu dēkhi dēkhi akulāi.
#### bārahiṃ bāra sanēha basa rāu lēi ura lāi..76.. [2-76]

The king felt much agitated as he gazed on his two sons with Sītā. Overwhelmed with emotion he pressed them to his bosom again and again.

The king was too restless to speak; there was terrible agony in his heart due to excess of grief. Most affectionately bowing His head at His father's feet, the Hero of Raghu's race then arose and asked his permission to proceed to the woods: "Father, give me your blessings and commands; why should you be sorrowing at this hour of jubilation? By swerving from the path of duty due to attachment for a beloved object, dear father, one's reputation is lost and obloquy incurred." Hearing this the king got up in his love and holding Śrī Rāma (the Lord of Raghus) by the arm he made Him sit down and said, "Listen, my boy: of You the sages declare that Rāma is the Lord of the entire creation, both animate and inanimate. God requites our actions according as they are good or bad, weighing them in the scale of His judgment. He alone who does an act reaps its consequences: such is the law of the Vedas and so declare all."

#### auru karai aparādhu kōu aura pāva phala bhōgu.
#### ati bicitra bhagavaṃta gati kō jaga jānai jōgu..77.. [2-77]

But in this case we find that one commits the offence and another reaps the fruit. Highly mysterious are the ways of God: no one in this world is competent to know them."

The king sincerely tried every means to detain Śrī Rāma. But he discovered Śrī Rāma's intention and came to know that He was not going to stay, a champion of righteousness, strong-minded and foresighted as He was. The king thereupon clasped Sītā to his bosom and most lovingly admonished Her in many ways. He described the terrible hardships of forest life and explained to Her the comforts She would enjoy if She chose to stay with Her husband's parents or Her own father. Sītā's mind, however, was attached to Śrī Rāma's feet; hence neither home seemed attractive to Her nor the forest repulsive. Everyone else too expostulated with Sītā dwelling on the many miseries of the forest. The minister's (Sumantra's) wife as well as the preceptor's (Vasiṣṭha's) and other prudent ladies fondly urged Her in gentle tones: "Nobody has exiled you to the forest: therefore, do as your husband's parents and preceptor bid you."

### Dohas

#### sikha sītali hita madhura mṛdu suni sītahi na sōhāni.
#### sarada caṃda caṃdani lagata janu cakaī akulāni..78.. [2-78]

This advice, soothing, friendly, agreeable and tender as it was, did not sound pleasing to Sītā's ears. It seemed as if the touch of the rays of the autumnal moon had made a female Cakravāka bird restless.

#### rāmu turata muni bēṣu banāī. calē janaka jananihi siru nāī.. [2-78-4]

Sītā was too modest to give any reply. But Kaikeyī flared up on hearing their talk. She brought hermits robes, ornaments and vessels and, placing them before Śrī Rāma, addressed Him in soft accents, "You are dear as life to the king, O Hero of Raghu's line; he is too soft to shake off his scruple and attachment for you. He would sooner forfeit his virtue, good reputation and his happiness in the other world than ask you to proceed to the woods. Bearing this in mind do as you please." Śrī Rāma rejoiced to hear His stepmother's admonition; but her words pierced the king like shafts. "Will my wretched life never depart," he said to himself. The people felt much distressed while the king fainted; no one knew what to do. Śrī Rāma presently dressed Himself as a hermit and bowing His head to His parents departed.

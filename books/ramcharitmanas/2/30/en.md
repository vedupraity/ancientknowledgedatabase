### The Niṣāda's suspicion and precautions

Halting on the bank of the Saī* river they resumed their journey at daybreak and the whole party drew near to Śṛṅgaverapura†. When the Niṣāda chief (Guha) heard the whole story, he anxiously thought within himself: "What motive can Bharata have in journeying to the woods? He must have some evil design at heart. If he had no mischievous intention at heart, why should he have brought an army with him? He must have thought that after killing Rāma and his younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) he would reign peacefully and happily. But Bharata did not take to heart the maxims of sound polity; latterly he brought on himself stigma alone but this time he will meet a sure death. If all the warriors among the gods and demons combine against Śrī Rāma, even they will fail to conquer him in battle. But what wonder that Bharata should behave as he is doing; for venomous plants, after all, can never bear fruits of ambrosia."

- ***** The Saī rises about midway between the Gomatī and the Gaṅgā and falls into the former 10 miles below the city of Jaunpur.
- **†** The site of the ancient Śṛṅgaverapura is marked by a village bearing the same name under the modernized form 'Singraur' 22 miles to the north-west of Allahabad. The Gaṅgā has changed its course and only a small branch now flows through the old channel.

Pondering thus Guha said to his kinsmen, "Be alert all of you; collect the boats and sink them and blockade the ghats (flight of steps leading to the river landingplace)."

Equip yourself and blockade the ghats; be prepared in everyway to face death. I go to encounter Bharata in open combat and would not let him cross the Gaṅgā so long as there is life in me. To die in battle and that too on the bank of the Gaṅgā; and to lay down this frail body in Śrī Rāma's cause! Then Bharata is Śrī Rāma's own brother and a king; while I am an humble servant! It is through a great good fortune that one meets with a death like this. In the cause of my master I will fight on the battlefield and will brighten the fourteen spheres with my glory. I am going to lay down my life for the sake of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of Raghus) and will be a gainer either way. (If I win the battle I will have served the cause of my master, and if I die I will attain the eternal abode of the Lord and his constant service.) He who is not reckoned among the virtuous and is neither counted among Śrī Rāma's devotees lives in vain in this world; he is a veritable burden to the earth and an axe to the tree of his mother's youth."

The Niṣāda chief, who was not the least troubled at heart, encouraged all and, fixing his thought on Śrī Rāma, forthwith demanded his quiver, bow and coat of mail.

Make haste, brethren, to get ready the necessary equipment; on hearing my command, let no one shrink in fear." "All right, my lord," they all joyfully responded, and roused the spirit of one another. Greeting their chief one after another, the Niṣādas left; they were all brave and loved to fight on the battlefield. Invoking the shoes of Śrī Rāma's lotus feet they fastened their quiver and strung their bow. Nay, they donned their coat of mail, placed the helmet on their head and straightened their axe, bludgeon and spear. Some of them who were exceptionally clever at fencing, sprang with such agility that it seemed they never touched the ground and moved in the air. Equipping themselves with their weapons etc., and forming themselves into batches they all went up to their chief, Guha, and greeted him. Seeing his gallant warriors and finding them all fit for active service he addressed them, each by his name, and duly honoured them.

Spare not your life, brethren; there is a great issue before me today." At this the gallant warriors spiritedly exclaimed, "Have patience, our brave chieftain!"

Through the majesty of Śrī Rāma and by your might, my lord, we shall leave no fighting man or horse in the enemy's ranks. We shall never retrace our steps so long as there is life in us; nay, we shall strew the earth with the trunks and heads of fallen warriors!" The Niṣāda chief saw that he had a good band of warriors and exclaimed, "Beat the martial drum." Even as he said so someone sneezed on the left. The sooth- sayers said, "The sneeze has come from an auspicious quarter! (The issue will be a happy one.)" An old man thought over the meaning of the omen and exclaimed, "Let us go and meet Bharata; there will be no conflict. Bharata is out to persuade Śrī Rāma to return. The omen tells us that there will be no discord." On hearing this Guha said, "The old man says aright. Fools act precipitately and repent. If we come to a clash without knowing Bharata's intentions and ascertaining his temper and disposition, we shall be doing much harm to our own cause.

"I shall test his love on the touchstone of his friendly disposition; for hatred and love cannot be disguised even if one tries to do so." So saying he began to collect articles for making a present and sent for bulbs, roots and fruits as well as birds and deer. Men of the porter class also brought loads of fat and ripe fish of the Pathina* species. Thus equipping himself with presents he proceeded to meet Bharata and met with auspicious and happy omens. As soon as he saw the chief of sages, Vasiṣṭha, he mentioned his own name and prostrated himself before the sage from a distance. The sage, who knew him to be a friend of Śrī Rāma, bestowed his blessing on him and told Bharata in detail about him. Hearing that he was a friend of Śrī Rāma, Bharata alighted from his chariot and, leaving it behind, advanced towards him with a heart overflowing with love. Guha, on his part mentioned his village, caste and name and greeted him by placing his head on the ground.

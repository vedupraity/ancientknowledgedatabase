Meeting and embracing Sītā again and again they politely allowed Her to depart and availing herself of this opportunity the clever queen eloquently told the king all about Bharata's condition.

When the king heard of Bharata's conduct, which was rare as a combination of gold with fragrance or as nectar extracted from the moon,* the king closed his tearful eyes and a thrill ran through his body as he broke out into ecstatic praises of his bright glory. "Listen attentively, O fair-faced and bright-eyed lady; the story of Bharata loosens the bounds of worldly existence. Religion, statecraft and an enquiry about Brahma (the Infinite) are domains to which I have some access according to my own poor lights. But thought acquainted with these subjects, my wits cannot touch the shadow of Bharata's glory even by trick, much less describe it. To Brahmā (the Creator), Lord Gaṇapati (Gaṇeśa) Śeṣa (the king of serpents), Lord Śiva, Śāradā (the goddess of learning), seers, sages and wise men and others who are clever in judgment, the story, fame, doings, piety, amiability, goodness and unsullied glory of Bharata are delightful to hear and appreciate. They surpass the celestial stream in purity and even nectar in taste.

- ***** Nectar as found in the region of Nāgas etc., is itself rare, but that, which forms the essence of the moon is even rarer. Hence the conduct of Bharata has been likened to the same.

"Possessed of infinite virtues and a man above comparison, know Bharata alone to be the like of Bharata. Can Mount Sumeru be likened to a seer?* Hence the wit of the race of poets was confused (in finding a comparison for him).

"The greatness of Bharata, O fair lady, baffles all who attempt to describe it, even as a fish cannot glide on dry land. Listen, O beloved queen: Bharata's inestimable glory is known to Śrī Rāma alone; but he too cannot describe it." Having thus lovingly described Bharata's glory the king, who knew his queen's mind, continued, "If Lakṣmaṇa returns to Ayodhyā and Bharata accompanies Śrī Rāma to the woods, it will be well for all and that is what everyone wants. But the mutual affection and confidence, O good lady, of Bharata and Śrī Rāma (the chief of Raghus) are beyond one's conception. Even though Śrī Rāma is the highest example of even-mindedness, Bharata is the perfection of love and attachment. Bharata has never bestowed any thought on his spiritual or worldly interests or personal comforts. Devotion to Śrī Rāma's feet is at once the means and the end; to my mind this appears to sum up Bharata's creed.

"Bharata would never think of flouting Śrī Rāma's orders even unwittingly. We need not, therefore, in our affection give way to anxiety," said the king in choked accents.

As the king and queen (Janaka and Sunayanā) were thus fondly recounting the virtues of Śrī Rāma and Bharata the night passed like an instant. At daybreak both the royal camps awoke and after finishing their ablutions proceeded to worship gods. Performing His ablutions the Lord of Raghus called on His Guru and after adoring his feet and receiving his tacit permission said,"Holy sir, Bharata, the citizens and my mothers are all stricken with grief and inconvenienced by their sojourn in the woods. The king of Mithilā too and his followers have been enduring hardships for many days past. Therefore, my lord, do what is advisable under the circumstances. The welfare of all lies in your hands." So saying Śrī Rāma felt much embarrassed. And the sage was thrilled with joy when he saw His amiability and kind disposition. "Without you, Rāma, all amenities of life are like hell to both the royal camps.

"Rāma! you are the life of life, the soul of soul and the joy of joy." Those who like to be in their home away from you, my child, are under the influence of an adverse fate.

"Perish the happiness, ritual and piety in which there is no devotion to the lotus feet of Rāma (yourself). That Yoga (discipline conducive to union with God) is an abominable Yoga and that wisdom unwisdom, in which love for Rāma yourself) is not supreme. Whosoever is unhappy is unhappy without you and even so whoever is happy is happy through you. You know what exists in the mind of a particular individual. Your command holds sway over all and your gracious self knows all the ways full well. You may return to your hermitage now." The lord of sages was overpowered with emotion. Śrī Rāma then made obeisance and departed, while the sage collected himself and called on King Janaka. The preceptor repeated to the king Śrī Rāma's naturally graceful words, which were full of amiability and affection, and added, "O great monarch, now do that which may do good to all without prejudice to religion."

#### Dialogue between Lakṣmaṇa and mother Sumitrā

#### Dohas

##### samujhi sumitrāom rāma siya rūpa susīlu subhāu.
##### nṛpa sanēhu lakhi dhunēu siru pāpini dīnha kudāu..73.. [2-73]

Remembering the beauty, amiability and noble disposition of Śrī Rāma and Sītā and considering the king's affection for Them, Sumitrā beat her head as she perceived that the wicked queen (Kaikeyī) had played him foul. (73)

Perceiving that the time was unpropitious to them she collected herself and, possessing as she did a naturally good heart, spoke in gentle words, "My dear son, Videha's daughter is your mother while Rāma, who loves you in everyway, is your father. Ayodhyā is there where Rāma dwells; there alone is the day where there is sunlight. If Sītā and Rāma are really proceeding to the woods, you have no business in Ayodhyā. One's preceptor, parents, brother, gods and master-all these should be tended as one's own life. Rāma, however is dearer than life, the soul of our soul and the disinterested friend of all. Whosoever are worthy of adoration and most dear to us should be accounted as such only in so far as they are related to Rāma. Bearing this in mind, accompany him to the forest and derive, my boy, the benefit of your existence in the world.

##### bhūri bhāga bhājanu bhayahu mōhi samēta bali jāu.
##### jauma tumharēṃ mana chāḍai chalu kīnha rāma pada ṭhāu..74.. [2-74]

It is your great good fortune as well as mine, I solemnly declare, that your mind has sincerely taken up its abode in Rāma's feet."

"That woman alone can be said to have borne a male issue, whose son is a devotee of Rāma (the Lord of Raghus). Otherwise she had better remain issueless; for she who deems herself fortunate in having a son hostile to Rāma has yeaned in vain. It is due to your good fortune that Rāma is proceeding to the forest; there is no other ground for his doing so, my boy. The highest reward of all meritorious acts is verily this-to have spontaneous love for the feet of Sītā and Rāma. Never give way even in a dream to passion, anger, jealousy, arrogance or infatuation. Giving up all sorts of morbid feelings serve them in thought, word and deed. You will be happy in everyway in the forest since you will have with you your father and mother in Rāma and Sītā. Take care, my son, that Rāma may be put to no trouble in the woods: that is my admonition to you."

#### Chhands

##### upadēsu yahu jēhiṃ tāta tumharē rāma siya sukha pāvahīṃ.
##### pitu mātu priya parivāra pura sukha surati bana bisarāvahīṃ..
##### tulasī prabhuhi sikha dēi āyasu dīnha puni āsiṣa daī.
##### rati hōu abirala amala siya raghubīra pada nita nita naī..

My admonition to you, dear child, is this: it is up to you to see that Rāma and Sītā lead a happy life in the forest through your good offices and forget their father and mother, near and dear ones as well as the amenities of city life." Having thus admonished the Lord of Tulasīdāsa (Lakṣmaṇa) Sumitrā granted him leave (to accompany Śrī Rāma) and then invoked her blessing on him: "May your devotion to the feet of Sītā and the Hero of Raghu's race be constant and untainted and ever new."

##### mātu carana siru nāi calē turata saṃkita hṛdayaom.

Bowing his head at his mother's feet Lakṣmaṇa left at once with a timid heart apprehending any further development that might bulk his plans and interfere with his accompanying (Śrī Rāma to the forest); it looked as if a deer had luckily succeeded in bursting a strong snare and made good his escape.

Lakṣmaṇa went straight to where the Lord of Jānakī (Janaka's Daughter) was; he was glad at heart to find himself in the company of his beloved Brother. Bowing to the charming feet of Śrī Rāma and Sītā he accompanied Them to the king's palace. The men and women of the city said to one another, "How strange that God wellnigh fulfilled our hopes and then shattered them!" With emaciated bodies, a sorrowful heart and doleful face they felt miserable as a bee that has been robbed of its honey. They wrung their hands, beat their heads and lamented like birds that had been clipt of their wings and were restless without them. A huge crowd had collected at the entrance of the royal palace and there was untold grief which knew no bounds. The minister (Sumantra) raised the king and seated him communicating to him the agreeable news that Śrī Rāma had come. When he saw his two sons with Sītā, his distress was profound.

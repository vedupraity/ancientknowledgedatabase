Perish that property, house, happiness, friend, father, mother or brother, who does not gladly help one turn one's face towards Śrī Rāma's feet!"

In every house they got ready vehicles of various kinds; their soul rejoiced at the thought of starting early next morning. On reaching his own apartments Bharata thought to himself: "The city, horses, elephants, houses and the treasury-everything belongs to the Lord of Raghus. If I leave it unprotected, the result will not be good for me; for disloyalty to one's master is the greatest of all sins. A servant is he who serves the interests of his master, no matter if anyone brings millions of imputations against him." Pondering thus he summoned faithful servants who had never dreamt of flinching from their duty. Confiding to them all the secrets he taught them their paramount duty and entrusted them with the work for which they were severally fit. After making all arrangements and posting guards Bharata went to Śrī Rāma's mother (Kausalyā).

Knowing all the mothers in distress, Bharata, who understood the ways of love, ordered palanquins to be got ready and sedan-chairs to be equipped.

Much afflicted at heart like the male and female Cakravāka birds, the men and women of the city longed for the dawn. They kept awake the whole night till it was daybreak, when Bharata summoned his wise counsellors and said to them, "Take all that is necessary for the installations ceremony; the sage (Vasiṣṭha) will crown Śrī Rāma even in the forest. Start expeditiously." Hearing this the ministers greeted him and had the horses, chariots and elephants immediately equipped. Taking with him his wife, Arundhatī, and the requisites for Agnihotra* (offering oblations into the sacred fire) the chief of sages, Vasiṣṭha, was the first to mount the chariot and led the way. Hosts of Brāhmaṇas, who were all repositories of austerity and spiritual glow followed in vehicles of various kinds. The people of the city followed next; having equipped their own conveyances they all left for Citrakūṭa. All the queens journeyed in palanquins which were lovely beyond words.

- ***** In ancient times, as a general rule, every Brāhmaṇa maintained the sacred fire and kept it perpetually alive till his death, when he was cremated with the same fire. He carried it with him wherever he went and poured oblations into it every morning and evening.

Leaving the city in the charge of faithful servants and respectfully sending the whole party ahead, the two brothers, Bharata and Śatrughna, started last of all, remembering the feet of Śrī Rāma and Sītā.

Seized with a longing for the sight of Śrī Rāma, all the people, including both men and women, headed with the same zeal as male and female elephants rush in pursuit of water. Realizing in their heart that Sītā and Rāma were in the woods Bharata and his younger brother journeyed on foot. Seeing their affection the people were overcome with emotion and dismounting walked on foot, leaving their horses, elephants and chariots. Going up to Bharata Śrī Rāma's mother (Kausalyā) stopped her palanquin by his side and spoke in soft accents, "I adjure you by my life to mount the chariot, dear child; or else all our near and dear ones will be put to trouble. If you walk on foot the whole party will follow suit and you know they are all wasted with sorrow and hardly fit to undertake the journey on foot." Reverently obeying her command and bowing their head at her feet the two brothers mounted their chariot and proceeded on the journey. They halted the first day on the bank of the Tamasā* river and made the next halt on the bank of the Gomatī.

- ***** The Tamasā (now popularly known by the name of Tons) is a branch of Ghāgharā which leaves that river about 10 miles from Ayodhyā and after flowing past the town of Azamgarh falls into the Sarayū.

Some of them lived on milk and some on fruits; while others took their meals by night. Renouncing ornaments and luxuries they observed vows and fasts for the sake of Śrī Rāma.

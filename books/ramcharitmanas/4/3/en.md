Then Hanumān related all the circumstances of both the sides, and having installed the sacred fire as a witness he concluded a firm alliance (between Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva).

The alliance was thus unreservedly concluded and Lakṣmaṇa narrated all the past history of Śrī Rāma. Said Sugrīva with his eyes full of tears, "The daughter of Janaka (the lord of Mithilā), my lord, will be surely recovered. On one occasion when I sat here deliberating with my counsellors I saw her fallen in the enemy's hands and being borne through the air loudly wailing. Crying 'Rāma, Rāma, Ah! my Rāma' she dropped her scarf when she saw us." When Śrī Rāma asked for that he handed it over to Him at once. Śrī Rāma pressed it to His bosom and grieved much. Said Sugrīva, "Listen, O hero of Raghu's line; sorrow no more and take courage in your heart. I will render service to you in every way so that Janaka's daughter may come and see you."

The Ocean of Mercy, who was at the same time the highest embodiment of physical strength, rejoiced to hear his ally's words, "Tell me, Sugrīva, why have you come to stay in the forest?"

"My lord, Vāli and myself are two brothers. The affection that existed between us was past all telling. Once upon a time, O lord, the son of the demon Māyā, who was known by the name of Māyāvī, came to our town (Kiṣkindhā). At dead of night he called out at the gate of the town. Vāli could not brook his enemy's challenge to a bout and sallied forth to meet him. But when he saw Vāli coming, he took to flight. I too had accompanied my brother. The enemy went and entered the cave of a big mountain. Then Vāli gave instructions to me, "Await my return till a fortnight. If I do not return, then take me as slain." When I had waited there for a month, O slayer of Khara, a copious stream of blood issued from the cave. I, therefore, concluded that the demon had slain Vāli and that he would come and kill me too. Accordingly I blocked the mouth of the cave with a rock and fled away. When the ministers saw the town without a master, they forced me to accept the throne. Meanwhile Vāli, who had killed the enemy, returned home and saw me (installed on the throne), he nursed a grudge against me in his heart. He gave me a most severe beating as he would an enemy, and robbed me of all that I had including my wife. For fear of him, O gracious Hero of Raghu's line, I wandered all over the world in a pitiable condition. A curse* prevents him from coming over here; yet I remain ill at ease in mind." When the gracious Lord heard of His devotee's distress both His long arms started throbbing (thus showing His martial spirit as well as His determination to punish Vāli).

- ***** The demon Māyāvī had a younger brother, Dundubhi by name. Dundubhi too had, on a previous occasion, attacked Vāli in the form of a buffalo and was slain by him . Vāli hurled the gigantic corpse of the buffalo to a distance of eight miles from his capital. A few drops of blood, however, fell from its mouth in the hermitage of sage Mataṅga on the §Rṣyamūka hill. This enraged the §Ṛṣi, who pronounced a curse that whoever had desecrated his hermitage by spilling blood there would have his head shattered to pieces if he dared approach the precincts of his hermitage.

"One would incur great sin by the very sight of those who are not distressed to see the distress of a friend. A man should regard his own mountain-like troubles as of no more account than a mere grain of sand, while the troubles of a friend should appear to him like Mount Sumeru, though really they may be as trifling as a grain of sand. Those fools who are not of such a temperament presume in vain to make friends with anybody. A friend should restrain his companion from the evil path and lead him on the path of virtue; he should proclaim the latter's good points and screen his faults, should give and take things without any scruple and serve his friend's interest to the best of his ability and finding him in distress love him a hundred times more than ever. The Vedas declare these to be the qualities of a noble friend. He, however, who contrives to speak bland words to your face and harms you behind your back and harbours some evil design in his heart, and whose mind is as tortuous as the movements of a snake is an unworthy friend and one had better bid good-bye to such a friend. A stupid servant, a stingy monarch, a bad wife and a false friend-these four are tormenting like a pike. Relying on my strength, dear friend, grieve no more; I will serve your cause in everyway possible." Said Sugrīva, "Listen, O Hero of Raghu's race: Vāli is possessed of immense strength and is exceedingly staunch in battle." He then showed Him Dundubhi's bones and the seven palm-trees, which were struck down by the Lord of Raghus without any exertion. When Sugrīva witnessed Śrī Rāma's immeasurable strength his affection for Him grew all the more and he was now satisfied that he would succeed in killing Vāli. He bowed his head at His feet again and again and was delighted at heart to recognize the Lord. When the light of wisdom dawned on him, he said; "My mind, O Lord, has been set at rest by Your grace. Renouncing pleasure, prosperity, home, personal glory and all I will render service to You. All these are stumbling-blocks on the path of Devotion to Śrī Rāma (Yourself): so declare saints given to the worship of Your feet. Pairs of opposites such as friend and foe, joy and sorrow, in this world are products of Māyā (Illusion) and have no reality. Vāli is my greatest friend, by whose grace I have met You, Rāma, the Allayer of sorrow. On waking from a dream when a man comes to know the identity of him with whom he had fought in the dream, he feels abashed. Now, my Lord, do me this favour that I may renounce all and worship You night and day." On hearing the words of Sugrīva, imbued as they were with dispassion, Śrī Rāma, who held a bow in His hand, smiled and said, "Whatever you have said is all true; but my words, O friend, can never be otherwise." Śrī Rāma (says the saint Kākabhuśuṇḍi), O Garuḍa (king of birds), makes us all dance even as a juggler would make his monkey dance: so declare the Vedas. Taking Sugrīva with Him the Lord of Raghus proceeded with a bow and arrow in His hands. Then the Lord of Raghus sent Sugrīva, who, strengthened by Śrī Rāma, thundered under the very nose of Vāli. On hearing his roar Vāli sallied forth frantic with fury. His wife, however, clasped his feet with her hands and warned him thus: "Listen, my lord: the two brothers with whom Sugrīva has concluded an alliance are of unapproachable majesty and might. They are no other than Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, the sons of King Daśaratha (the lord of Kosala), who can conquer Death himself on the field of battle."

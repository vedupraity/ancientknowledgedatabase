With great agility Lakṣmaṇa struck off her nose and ears, thereby inviting Rāvaṇa through her to a contest as it were.

Without nose and ears she wore a hideous aspect and looked like a mountain flowing with torrents of red ochre. She went sobbing to Khara and Dūṣaṇa: "Fie, fie upon your manhood and strength, brothers!" Questioned by them she told them everything in detail; hearing her report the demon chiefs gathered an army. Swarming multitudes of demons of diverse shapes rushed forth like hosts of winged mountains of collyrium on vehicles of various kinds. They were infinite in number and were armed with terrible weapons of various kinds. They placed at their head Śūrpaṇakhā shorn of her ears and nose and thus presenting an inauspicious sight. Numberless ill-omens of a fearful nature occured to them; but the host heeded them not, doomed as they all were to death. They roared and bullied and sprang in the air; and the champions were filled with excessive joy to see the army. Said one, "Capture the two brothers alive and having captured them kill them and carry off the woman." The vault of heaven was overhung with the dust raised by them. (Seeing this) Śrī Rāma called His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and said," "Take Janaka's Daughter to some mountain-cave; a terrible array of demons has come. Therefore, remain on your guard." Obedient to his lord's command he withdrew (to a safe retreat) with Sītā, bow and arrow in hand. When Śrī Rāma saw that the hostile force had advanced, He smiled as He strung His formidable bow

As He coiled His matted locks into a tuft on His head after stringing His formidable bow, it seemed as if a pair of snakes were engaged in a conflict with countless streaks of lightning on a mountain of emerald. Having girded up His quiver at His waist, and clasping the bow with His long arms and putting His arrows in order, He looked at the enemy even as a lion (the king of the beasts) would glare at a herd of large elephants.

Valiant champions came rushing with all speed shouting "Seize him, seize him!" even as the demons* close round upon the rising sun finding it all alone

- ***** It is mentioned in our scriptures that a special class of demons known by the name of 'Mandehas' close round upon the rising sun, weapons in hand, every morning and are driven away by the drops of water thrown into the air by way of 'Arghya' in course of the 'Sandhyā' prayer. Thus it is all the more necessary that every member of the twice-born classes should perform his Sandhyā before sunrise every morning without fail.

Even as they beheld the Lord the invading warriors could not discharge their arrows; the whole demon host became powerless. Khara and Dūṣaṇa summoned their ministers and said, "This prince, whoever he may be, is an ornament of the human race. Of all the Nāgas, demons, gods, human beings and sages that exist (in this universe) we have seen, vanquished or slain many. But during our whole life, listen to us, our brethren all, we have never beheld such beauty. Even though he has disfigured our sister, he does not deserve death, peerless as he is among men. 'Surrender to us at once the woman you have put in hiding somewhere and return home with your life, both you and your brother.' Deliver this message of mine to him and return immediately with his reply." The heralds went to Śrī Rāma and delivered the message to Him, in reply to which Śrī Rāma smilingly said, "We are Kṣatriyas by birth and are given to hunting in the woods; wretches like you are the game that we are tracking. We are never dismayed at the sight of a mighty foe and would give battle to Death himself if he ever appeared before us. Though human beings, we are the exterminators of the race of demons and, though youthful in appearance, we are the protectors of the hermits and the torment of the wicked. If you have no strength to fight, you had better return home; I will never kill an enemy who has turned his back upon the field of battle. When you have come up to fight, it would be the height of weakness to play wily pranks or to show compassion to your enemy." The heralds returned forthwith and repeated all that they had been told. The heart of Khara and Dūṣaṇa was on fire when they heard it.

Their heart was on fire and they exclaimed, "Capture him," hearing which fierce demon champions rushed forth, all armed with bows and arrows, steel clubs, pikes, spears, scimitars, maces and axes. First of all the Lord gave His bow a twang-shrill, terrific and fearful-which deafened the ears of and dismayed the demons, who had no sense left in them

Having learnt that they were confronting a powerful enemy, the demon warriors now rushed with caution and began to hurl missiles and weapons of various kinds on Śrī Rāma. The Hero of Raghu's line, however, tore them into pieces as small as sesamum seeds and then drawing the bow-string to His ear let fly His own arrows.

Then the terrible arrows sped forth, hissing like so many serpents. Śrī Rāma got infuriated in battle and arrows, exceedingly sharp, flew from His bow. The demon warriors turned and fled when they found the arrows so very keen . The three brothers (Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśirā) now flew into rage: "Whoever flees from the battle-field will be killed by us with our own hands." At this the warriors turned back, fully resolved to die, and made a frontal attack with weapons of every description. Perceiving that the enemy was exceedingly furious, the Lord fitted arrows to His bow and discharged many a shaft of the 'Nārāca' type with the result that frightful fields began to be mowed down. Trunks, heads, arms, hands and feet began to drop to the ground here, there and everywhere. Pierced by shafts, they yelled and their trunks fell like mountains. The bodies of the warriors were torn into a hundred pieces and resorting to deceptive methods they stood up again. A number of arms and heads flew through the air and headless trunks ran to and fro. Birds like kites and crows and jackals wrangled in a cruel and awful way. Jackals wrangled; ghosts, spirits and fiends filled the bowls of skulls with blood: devils clashed the heads of slain warriors like cymbals and the Yoginīs* danced. Śrī Rāma's fierce arrows tore to pieces the leaders' breast, arms and heads; their bodies fell on every side but stood up again to fight with terrible cries of "Seize, capture!" Vultures flew away with the end of entrails in their claws, while goblins scampered with the other end held in their hands; one might fancy numberless children of the town of the battle-field were flying kites. A large number of champions, that had been smitten or knocked down or whose breast had been torn, lay moaning. Finding their army in distress leaders like Triśirā, Khara and Dūṣaṇa turned towards Śrī Rāma. Countless demons hurled furiously against the Hero of Raghu's line, arrows, spears, iron clubs, axes, javelins and daggers all at once. In the twinkling of an eye the Lord warded off the enemy's shafts and sent forth His own arrows, planting ten shafts in the breast of each champion of the demon host. The leaders fell to the ground but rose again and joined in the fray. Yet they would not die and played very many tricks. The gods trembled with fear when they saw that the demons numbered fourteen thousand, while the Lord of Ayodhyā was all alone. Finding the gods and sages alarmed, the Lord, who is the Controller of Māyā (Cosmic Illusion), wrought a great miracle. The demons saw one another in the form of Śrī Rāma, so that the enemy's warriors fought among themselves and perished.

They quitted their body crying "Rāma! Rāma!!" and thereby attained the state of eternal bliss. Falling back upon this device the Ocean of Mercy killed the enemy in an instant. The gods in their exultation rained down flowers and kettle-drums sounded in the heavens. And hymning their praises one after another they all left, shining in their cars of various patterns.

When the Lord of Raghus had vanquished the foe in battle, the gods, human beings and sages were all rid of fear. Then Lakṣmaṇa brought Sītā back; and as he fell at His feet the Lord joyously clasped him to His bosom. Sītā fixed Her gaze on His swarthy and delicate form with utmost affection; but Her eyes knew no satiety. Thus dwelling at Pañcavaṭī the blessed Lord of Raghus performed deeds that delighted gods and sages alike. Perceiving the destruction of Khara and Dūṣaṇa, Śūrpaṇakhā approached Rāvaṇa and instigated him (against Śrī Rāma). In great fury she rated him in the following words: "Discarding all thought of your realm and exchequer you drink and sleep day and night and take no heed of the enemy, who is now at your very door. Sovereignty without political insight, wealth divorced from virtue, noble deeds that have not been offered to Śrī Hari (God) and learning which does not beget wisdom is nothing but fruitless labour to the man who has gained such kingdom or wealth, to the doer of the noble acts and to the student respectively. A recluse is quickly undone by attachment, a king by evil counsel, wisdom by conceit, modesty by drinking, friendship by want of love, and man of merit by vanity: such is the maxim I have heard.

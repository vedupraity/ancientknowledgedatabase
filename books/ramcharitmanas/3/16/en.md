### The glory of hearing the praises of Śrī Rāma and an exhortation to cultivate fellowship with saints and practise adoration

### Dohas

#### gunāgāra saṃsāra dukha rahita bigata saṃdēha..
#### taji mama carana sarōja priya tinha kahu dēha na gēha..45.. [3-45]

They are abodes of virtue, above the sorrows of the world and free from doubt. Nothing besides My lotus feet is dear to them, not even their body nor their home."

### Chaupais

#### nija guna śravana sunata sakucāhīṃ. para guna sunata adhika haraṣāhīṃ..
#### sama sītala nahiṃ tyāgahiṃ nītī. sarala subhāu sabahiṃ sana prītī.. [3-45-1]
#### japa tapa brata dama saṃjama nēmā. guru gōbiṃda bipra pada prēmā..
#### śraddhā chamā mayatrī dāyā. muditā mama pada prīti amāyā.. [3-45-2]
#### birati bibēka binaya bigyānā. bōdha jathāratha bēda purānā..
#### daṃbha māna mada karahiṃ na kāū. bhūli na dēhiṃ kumāraga pāū.. [3-45-3]
#### gāvahiṃ sunahiṃ sadā mama līlā. hētu rahita parahita rata sīlā..
#### muni sunu sādhunha kē guna jētē. kahi na sakahiṃ sārada śruti tētē.. [3-45-4]

They blush to hear themselves praised but feel much delighted to hear others' praises. Even-minded and placid, they never abandon the right course. Guileless by nature and loving, they are given over to prayer, austerity, control of the senses, selfdenial and religious observances and undertake sacred vows. They are devoted to the feet of their Guru, Lord Govinda (Viṣṇu) and the Brāhmaṇas. They are full of piety, forgiving, friendly to all, compassionate, cheerful under all circumstances and sincerely devoted to My feet. They are further characterized by dispassion, discretion, modesty, knowledge of the truth relating to God as well as by a correct knowledge of the Vedas and Purāṇas. They never take recourse to hypocrisy, pride or arrogance nor set their foot on the evil path even by mistake. They are ever engaged in singing or hearing My stories and are intent on doing good to others without any consideration. In short, O good sage, the qualities of the saints are so numerous that they cannot be exhausted even by Śāradā ( the goddess of speech) nor by the Vedas."

### Chhands

#### kahi saka na sārada sēṣa nārada sunata pada paṃkaja gahē.
#### asa dīnabaṃdhu kṛpāla apanē bhagata guna nija mukha kahē..
#### siru nāha bārahiṃ bāra carananhi brahmapura nārada gaē..
#### tē dhanya tulasīdāsa āsa bihāi jē hari raomga raomē..

Neither Śāradā nor Śeṣa could tell them!" Even as he heard this the sage Nārada clasped the Lord's lotus feet. In this way the all-merciful Lord, the befriender of the meek, recounted with His own lips the virtues of His devotees. Nārada bowed his head at the Lord's feet again and again and left for the abode of Brahmā (the Creator). Blessed are they, says Tulasīdāsa, who, giving up all hopes, are steeped in love for Śrī Hari.

### Dohas

#### rāvanāri jasu pāvana gāvahiṃ sunahiṃ jē lōga.
#### rāma bhagati dṛḍha pāvahiṃ binu birāga japa jōga..46ka.. [3-46(A)]
#### dīpa sikhā sama jubati tana mana jani hōsi pataṃga.
#### bhajahi rāma taji kāma mada karahi sadā satasaṃga..46kha.. [3-46(B)]

People who sing or hear the sanctifying praises of Rāvaṇa's Foe shall be rewarded with steadfast devotion to Śrī Rāma even without dispassion, prayer or concentration of mind. The body of a young woman is like fhe flame of a candle; be not a moth to it, O my mind. Abandoning lust and pride worship Śrī Rāma and enjoy the company of saints

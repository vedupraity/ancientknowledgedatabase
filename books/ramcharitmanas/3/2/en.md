### Jayanta's mischief and punishment

### Dohas

#### ati kṛpāla raghunāyaka sadā dīna para nēha.
#### tā sana āi kīnha chalu mūrakha avaguna gēha..1.. [3-1]

The Lord of Raghus is extremely compassionate and is always fond of the meek. But the mischievous fool came and played a trick even with Him.

Winged with a spell, the shaft presided over by Brahmā* sped forth and the crow in terror took to flight. Indra's son now assumed his own form and approached his father. But the latter refused to give him shelter knowing him to be an enemy of Śrī Rāma. Having lost hope ( of protection ) he felt as alarmed at heart as the sage Dūrvāsa was afraid of the Lord's Discus. Weary and stricken with fear and grief, he traversed the abode of Brahma, the realm of Lord Śiva and all other regions. But no one even asked him to sit down. Who can dare afford shelter to an enemy of Śrī Rāma ? Listen, Garuḍa (mount of Śrī Hari ), a mother becomes as terrible as death and a father assumes the role of Yama ( the god of death), ambrosia turns into venom and a friend becomes as hostile as a hundred enemies, the celestial river ( Gaṅgā ) is converted into the Vaitaraṇī† nay the whole world becomes hotter than fire to him who is inimical to Śrī Rāma. The sage Nārada saw Jayanta (Indra's son ) in distress and was moved with pity; for saints are always tender of heart. The sage sent him immediately to Śrī Rāma and he cried out, "Save me, O friend of the suppliant !" Bewildered and terrified he went and clasped His feet and said, "Mercy ! mercy ! O gracious Lord of Raghus. I could not perceive Your incomparable might and matchless glory, dull-witted as I am. I have reaped the fruit born by my own actions and have now sought refuge in You. Protect me, my Lord!" When the all-merciful Lord heard his most piteous appeal, He let him go with the loss of one eye, O Pārvatī.

- ***** Our scriptures mention a number of missiles each presided over by a particular deity and varying in its potency according to the god by whom it is presided over and which can be invoked on any earthly weapon by means of spells. For instance we hear of an Agni-Astra ( presided over by the fire-god ),a Vāyavyāstra (presided over by the wind-god), Parjanyāstra (presided over by the rain-god). Pāśupatāstra (presided over by Lord Śiva ) and Nārāyaṇāstra (presided over by Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa ) and so on. The Agni-Astra, when discharged, rains volleys of fire; the Vāyavyāstra lets loose strong winds; the Parjanyāstra releases clouds with showers and so on. It is unfortunate that the knowledge of this science, which was evidenced till the end of Dvāpara, has become extinct now.
- **†** The name of a river in hell, which the dead have to cross before entering the infernal regions. It is represented as a filthy stream full of blood, hair and bones and every other kind of impurity. It can be crossed only with the help of a cow that may have been gifted by the deceased during his life-time.

### Sortas

#### kīnha mōha basa drōha jadyapi tēhi kara badha ucita.
#### prabhu chāḍaēu kari chōha kō kṛpāla raghubīra sama..2.. [3-1-2]

Even though in his infatuation Jayanta had antagonized the Lord and therefore deserved death, the latter took compassion on him and let him go. Who is there so merciful as the Hero of Raghu's line ?

Staying at Citrakūṭa the Lord of Raghus performed exploits of many kinds, which are sweet to the ear as nectar. Śrī Rāma then thought to Himself, "People will throng here now that (everyone has come to know me." Taking leave of all the hermits, therefore, the two brothers ( Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa ) left the place with Sītā. When the Lord repaired to Atri's hermitage, the great sage was rejoiced at the news. Thrilling all over ( with joy) Atri sprang up and ran to meet Him; and seeing him come Śrī Rāma too advanced hurriedly towards him. Even as the two brothers prostrated themselves the sage lifted them, and clasping them to his bosom bathed them with tears of love. His eyes were gladdened by the sight of Śrī Rāma's beauty and then he reverently escorted them to his hermitage. Paying his homage to the Lord he spoke kind words to Him and offered Him roots and fruits, which He relished much.

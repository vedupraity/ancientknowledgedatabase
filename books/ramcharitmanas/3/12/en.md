#### The combat of Jaṭāyu with Rāvaṇa

#### Dohas

##### hāri parā khala bahu bidhi bhaya aru prīti dēkhāi.
##### taba asōka pādapa tara rākhisi jatana karāi..29ka.. [3-29(A)]
##### jēhi bidhi kapaṭa kuraṃga saomga dhāi calē śrīrāma.
##### sō chabi sītā rākhi ura raṭati rahati harināma..29kha.. [3-29(B)]

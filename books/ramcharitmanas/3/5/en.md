Bowing His head at the lotus feet of the sage, Śrī Rāma, the Lord of celestials, human beings and sages, proceeded to the woods. Śrī Rāma walked foremost, while Lakṣmaṇa followed Him in the rear, both appearing most lovely in the garb of hermits. Between the two Sītā ( who was the same as Śrī, the Goddess of Prosperity) shone forth like Māyā, which stands between Brahma (the Absolute) and the Jīva (the individual soul). Rivers and thickets, hills and rugged valleys recognized their Lord and gave Him a smooth passage. Wherever the divine Lord of Raghus passed the clouds made a canopy in the heavens, Even as the trio wended their way the demon Virādha met them; and the Hero of Raghu's line overthrew him as soon as he made his appearance. (Meeting his death at the hands of the Lord), he immediately attained a beauteous (divine) form; finding him lead a miserable existence the Lord sent him to His own abode, Accompanied by His lovely younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and Janaka's Daughter (Sītā) the Lord then visited the sage Śarabhaṅga.

Gazing on Śrī Rāma's lotus face the eyes of the great sage reverently drank in its beauty like bees. Blessed indeed was the birth of Śarabhaṅga!

Said the sage, "Listen, gracious Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line), the swan disporting in the Mānasa lake of Lord Śiva heart; I was about to leave for Brahmā's abode when the report reached my ears that Śrī Rāma (Yourself) was coming to the forest. I have ever since watched the road day and night. My heart is now soothed at the sight of my lord. I have accomplished nothing (to deserve Your grace); yet You have shown Your grace to me knowing me to be Your humble servant. Really speaking, however, You have done me no favour, my lord; You have only redeemed Your vow, O Stealer of Your devotees' hearts! For the sake of this humble servant remain here (before my eyes) till I have quitted this body and meet You ( in Your own abode)." So saying the sage offered to the Lord whatever practice of Yoga, sacrifices, Japa (muttering of prayers), penance and fasting he had done, and received in return the boon of Devotion. Having thus acquired the rare gift of Devotion the sage Śarabhaṅga prepared a funeral pile and discarding all attachment from his heart ascended it.

"Constantly abide in my heart, O Lord, with Sītā and your younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) in Your qualified and embodied form swarthy as a dark cloud, O graceful Rāma!"

Having said so he burnt his body with the fire of Yoga* and by the grace of Śrī Rāma rose to Vaikuṇṭha. The sage was not absorbed into the person of Śrī Hari for this simple reason that he had already received the boon of personal devotion. The multitude of sages (assembled on the occasion) who saw the high state to which the great sage had now been translated were greatly delighted at heart. All the hosts of sages now extolled the Lord, "Glory to the friend of the suppliant, the fountain of mercy." Then the Lord of Raghus went on further into the forest and many a host of great sage followed Him. Seeing a heap of bones the Lord of Raghus was moved with great compassion and enquired the hermits about the same. "Though knowing everything, how is it that You ask us, our master? We know You are all-seeing and can read the innermost feelings of all. Hosts of demons have devoured all the sages." The eyes of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's race) filled with tears when He heard this

The very sight and touch of the Sarayū, a dip into its waters or a draught from it cleanses one's sins-so declare the Vedas and Purāṇas. Even Śāradā, the goddess of learning, with Her pure intelligence cannot describe the infinite glory of this most sacred river. The beautiful town of Ayodhyā grants an abode in Śrī Rāma's heaven; it is celebrated through all the worlds and is the holiest of the holy. There are countless living beings in this world belonging to the four species (viz., viviparous, oviparous, sweat-born and those shooting from the earth); whoever of these shed their mortal coil in Ayodhyā are never born again. Knowing the town to be charming in everyway, a bestower of all forms of success and a storehouse of blessings, I commenced writing this sacred story there. The impulses of lust, arrogance and hypocrisy positively disappear from the mind of those who hear it. One derives solace by hearing its very name, Rāmacaritamānasa (the Mānasa lake of Śrī Rāma's exploits). The elephant of our mind, which is being scorched by the wild fire of sensuous enjoyments, is sure to get relief should it drop into this lake. The holy and beautiful Rāmacaritamānasa is the delight of sages; it was conceived by Śambhu (Lord Śiva). It puts down the three kinds of error, sorrow and indigence* and uproots all evil practices and impurities of the Kali age. Having conceived it, the great Lord Śiva treasured it in His mind till, when a favourable opportunity presented itself, He communicated it to His consort, Śiva (Pārvatī). Therefore, after due consideration Lord Hara joyously gave it the excellent title of Rāmacaritamānasa†. I repeat the same delightful and charming story; hear it reverently and attentively, O noble souls. (1-7)

- ***** The three kinds of error are those relating to thought, word and deed; birth, death and old age constitute the three kinds of sorrow and the three kinds of indigence referred to her are: (1) poverty of body (2) poverty in men and (3) poverty of means.
- **†** The word Mānasa also denotes the mind and Lord Śiva gave this story the title of 'Rāmacaritamānasa' firstly because it contains a life-account of Śrī Rāma and secondly because He treasured it in His mind before communicating it to Pārvatī

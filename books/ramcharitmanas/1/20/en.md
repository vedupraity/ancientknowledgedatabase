All the rivers bore holy waters; birds, beasts and bees, all rejoiced. All animals gave up their natural antipathies and all those who dwelt on the mountain loved one another. With the advent of Girijā (a synonym of Pārvatī) the mountain (Himālaya) wore a cheerful look even as devotion to Śrī Rāma lights up the face of a devotee. Everyday brought a new delight to the house of Himācala, whose glory was sung even by great gods like Brahmā (the Creator). Receiving all the news Nārada eagerly went to the house of Himācala. The king of mountains (the presiding deity of the Himālayas), received him with great honour; washing the sage's feet he led him to a beautiful seat. He bowed his head at the sage's feet alongwith his wife and had his whole mansion sprinkled with the water hallowed by his feet. Himācala extolled his own good luck and, summoning his daughter, placed her at the sage's feet. (1-4)

The sage smilingly replied in the following soft yet significant words: "Your daughter is a mine of all virtues-pretty, amiable and intelligent by nature. She will be called Umā, Ambikā (lit., mother) and Bhavānī. Adorned with all good traits, the girl shall win the unfailing love of her husband. She shall remain ever united with her lord and bring glory to her parents. She shall command the respect of the whole universe; he who waits upon her shall lack nothing. By the mere thought of her name women in this world shall be enabled to tread the path of fidelity to their lord, which is sharp as the edge of a sword. Your daughter, O Himālaya, is endowed with auspicious marks. Hear now the few drawbacks she possesses. Devoid of merits, free from pride, without father or mother, unconcerned and free from doubts- (1-4)

"An ascetic with matted hair and a heart devoid of longing, stark naked and with hideous accoutrements-such a one shall be her lord, as I can read from the lines on her palm." (67)

Hearing the words of the sage and believing them to be true, Himālaya and his wife became disconsolate; while Umā felt delighted. Even Nārada could not perceive this difference. Even though their outer expression was the same, their feeling was different, Girijā and all her playmates, Himālaya and his wife, Mainā, all had their hair standing on their end and their eyes were full of tears. The words of the celestial sage Nārada could not be untrue: Umā cherished them in her heart. Love for the lotus feet of Śiva sprouted in her heart. She however, felt diffident in her mind; union with Śiva appeared so difficult to her. Finding the time inopportune for its disclosure, she concealed her emotion and then sat down in the lap of one of her playmates.The prediction of the sage could not be false: the thought made Himavān and his wife as well as the senior playmates anxious. Collecting himself, the lord of mountains said, "Tell me, holy sir, what remedy should now be employed?" (1-4)

The chief of sages, Nārada, replied: "Hear, O Himavān; whatever has been decreed by Fate no one can undo-not even gods, demons, human beings, Nāgas or sages." (68)

"Nevertheless I tell you one remedy: this may avail if Heaven helps you. Umā will undoubtedly get such a husband as I have described to you. But whatever demerits I have shown in her bridegroom exist in Śiva so far as I can guess. If her marriage takes place with Śaṅkara, everyone will call the demerits as good as virtues. Even though Śrī Hari uses the serpent-god Śeṣa as His couch and sleeps thereon, the wise do not blame Him for the same. Even so the sun and fire absorb moisture in all forms, but no one calls them names. Again, water of every description, pure as well as impure, flows into the Gaṅgā; yet no one calls the heavenly stream impure. Even like the sun, fire and the Gaṅgā, the mighty incur no blame." (1-4)

"Holy men would never drink wine even if they came to know that it had been made of water from the Gaṅgā; but the same wine becomes pure when it is poured into the Gaṅgā. The difference between an individual soul and God should be similarly explained. Śambhu is all-powerful by nature; for He is no other than God Himself. Hence matrimony with Him will prove auspicious in everyway. The great Lord Śiva is certainly difficult to propitiate; but He is quickly pleased when penance is undergone. If your daughter practises austerity, the Slayer of the demon Tripura, Śiva, can even erase the lines of Fate. Even though there may be many a suitor in the world, there is no match for her except Śiva. He is the bestower of boons, the dispeller of the agony of the suppliant, an ocean of benevolence and the delight of His devotee. Without propitiating Śiva the object of one's desire cannot be attained through millions of Yogic practices and Japa (repetitions of a mystic formula)." (1-4)

##### asa kahi nārada sumiri hari girijahi dīnhi asīsa.

So saying and with his thoughts fixed on Śrī Hari, Nārada gave his blessings to Girijā and said, "Shed all fear, O lord of mountains; all will now turn out well." (70)

Having spoken thus, the sage returned to the abode of Brahmā (the Creator). Now hear the end of the story how it came about. Finding her husband alone, Mainā (Himālaya's wife) said to him, "My lord, I could not follow the words of the sage. If the match, his house and his pedigree are without parallel and worthy of our daughter, the marriage may be concluded. If not, the girl had better remain unmarried; for, my lord, Umā is dear to me as my own life. If we fail to secure a match worthy of Girijā, everyone will say Himālaya is dull by nature. Keep this in mind, my lord, while concluding an alliance, so that there may be no cause for repentance." Having spoken these words Mainā laid herself prostrate with her head at the feet of her lord. The lord of mountains, Himālaya, replied in endearing terms, "Sooner shall the moon emit flames of fire than the prophecy of Nārada should prove untrue." (1-4)

"Now if you cherish any love for your child, then go and admonish her that she should practise austerity which may bring about her union with Śiva: there is no other way of overcoming sorrow. The words of Nārada are pregnant and full of reason. Śiva (who bears a bull for His emblem) is handsome and a mine of all virtues: recognizing this truth do not entertain any misgiving. Śaṅkara is irreproachable in everyway." Hearing the above words of her husband Mainā felt delighted at heart; she at once rose and went where Girijā was. At the sight of Umā tears rushed to her eyes and she affectionately took the girl in her lap. Again and again she hugged the child; her voice was choked with emotion and she found herself tongue-tied. The Mother of the universe, the all-knowing Bhavānī, then spoke the following soft words, which brought delight to her mother:- (1-4)

##### priya parivāra pitā aru mātā. bhaē bikala mukha āva na bātā.. [1-72-4]

"Recognizing the truth of Nārada's words go and practise austerity, O mountainmaid; the idea has commended itself to your father and mother as well. Austerity is conducive to joy and puts an end to sorrow and evils. By virtue of penance the Creator creats the universe. By virtue of penance Viṣṇu protects the whole world. By virtue of penance Śambhu brings about dissolution. By virtue of penance, again, Śeṣa (the serpent-god) bears the burden of the earth on his head. In fact, the entire creation rests on penance, Bhavānī. Bearing this in mind, go and practise austerity." Hearing these words the mother was filled with wonder. She sent for Himālaya and communicated the vision to him. Consoling her parents in many ways Umā set out for penance in a joyous mood. Her loving household and parents felt miserable and none could speak a word. (1-4)

Cherishing in her heart the feet of her dear lord, Umā went to the forest and began her penance. Her delicate frame was little fit for austerities; yet she renounced all luxuries fixing her mind on the feet of her lord. Her devotion to the feet of her lord presented a new phase everyday; and she got so absorbed in penance that she lost all consciousness of her body. For a thousand years she lived on roots and fruits alone; while for another hundred years she subsisted on vegetables. For some days her only sustenance was water and air; while for a few days she observed a rigorous fast. For three thousand years she maintained herself on the withered leaves of the Bela* tree that dropped on the ground. Finally she gave up even dry leaves; Umā then came to be known by the name of Aparṇā (living without leaves). Seeing her body emaciated through self-mortification the deep voice of Brahmā (the Creator) resounded through the heavens:- (1-4)

- ***** The Bela tree (Aegle marmelos) is specially sacred to Śiva.

"There have been many self-possessed and illumined sages; but not one of them, Bhavānī, performed such penance as this. Now cherish in your heart this supreme utterance from heaven, knowing it to be invariably true and ever sacred. When your father comes to call you, give up all resistance and return home at once. Again, when the seven sages meet you, be assured of the veracity of this oracle." Girijā (the daughter of Himavān) rejoiced to hear this utterance of Brahmā echoed by heaven and a thrill ran through her limbs. [Yājñāvalkya says to Bharadvāja] I have thus sung the beautiful story of Umā; now hear the charming account of Śambhu. Ever since Satī went and quitted her body, Śiva's mind recoiled from everything. He ever repeated the name of the Lord of Raghus and heard the recitation of Śrī Rāma's glories here and there. (1-4)

Here He instructed the sages in wisdom and there He extolled the virtues of Śrī Rāma. Though passionless and all-wise, the Lord was smitten with the pangs of separation from His devotee (Satī). In this way a considerable time elapsed. Devotion to the feet of Śrī Rāma was ever budding in His heart. When Śrī Rāma saw the selfdiscipline and affection of Śaṅkara and the indelible stamp of devotion on His heart, the merciful Lord, who fully recognizes services rendered to Him, and is a mine of beauty and amiability and an embodiment of great splendour, appeared before Śaṅkara and extolled Him in ways more than one. "Who else than You can accomplish such a vow?" He said, Śrī Rāma admonished Him in many ways and told Him of the birth of Pārvatī. The Lord in His infinite compassion narrated at full length the most pious doings of Girijā. (1-4)

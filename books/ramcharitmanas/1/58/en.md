### The glory of hearing and singing the story of Śrī Rāma

### Dohas

#### rāma rūpu bhūpati bhagati byāhu uchāhu anaṃdu.
#### jāta sarāhata manahiṃ mana mudita gādhikulacaṃdu..360.. [1-360]

The delighter of Gādhi's race gladly went on his way praising to himself Śrī Rāma's beauty, King Daśaratha's piety, the wedding of Śrī Rāma and Sītā and the festivities and rejoicings connected therewith.

#### suni muni sujasu manahiṃ mana rāū. baranata āpana punya prabhāū.. [1-360-1]
#### bahurē lōga rajāyasu bhayaū. sutanha samēta nṛpati gṛhaom gayaū..

#### kabikula jīvanu pāvana jānī..rāma sīya jasu maṃgala khānī..
#### tēhi tē maiṃ kachu kahā bakhānī. karana punīta hētu nija bānī.. [1-360-4]

Vāmadeva and the wise preceptor of Raghu's race, Vasiṣṭha, once more narrated the story of Viśvāmitra (Gādhi's son). On hearing the sage's bright glory the king praised to himself the value of his stock of merits (which attracted the sage to his house and won for him his favour). At the royal command the people dispersed, while the king with his sons returned to his palace. Everywhere the people sang the story of Śrī Rāma's wedding, and His holy and fair fame was diffused through all the three spheres. From the day Śrī Rāma came home duly married, every kind of joy took its abode in Ayodhyā. The festivities that followed the Lord's wedding were more than the goddess of speech or the Lord of serpents, Śeṣa, could tell. I know that the glory of Śrī Rāma and Sītā is the very life and sanctifier of the race of poets and a mine of blessings; that is why I have said something about it just to hallow my speech

### Chhands

#### nija girā pāvani karana kārana rāma jasu tulasī kahyō.
#### raghubīra carita apāra bāridhi pāru kabi kaunēṃ lahyō..
#### upabīta byāha uchāha maṃgala suni jē sādara gāvahīṃ.
#### baidēhi rāma prasāda tē jana sarbadā sukhu pāvahīṃ..

For the purpose of hallowing his speech has Tulasīdāsa sung Śrī Rāma's glory; otherwise the story of Śrī Rāma is a limitless ocean, which no poet has ever been able to cross. Those men who reverently hear or sing the tale of the auspicious festivities attendant on Śrī Rāma's investiture with the sacred thread and marriage shall ever be happy by the grace of Videha's Daughter and Śrī Rāma.

### Sortas

#### siya raghubīra bibāhu jē saprēma gāvahiṃ sunahiṃ.
#### tinha kahu sadā uchāhu maṃgalāyatana rāma jasu..361.. [1-360-361]

Those who lovingly sing or hear the story of Sītā and Rāma's marriage shall ever rejoice; for Śrī Rāma's glory is an abode of felicity.

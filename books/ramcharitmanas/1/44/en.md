Saluting the lotus-feet of the sage the two brothers, the delight of the eyes of the whole world, departed. Beholding the exquisite beauty of the two brothers troops of boys followed them, their eyes and mind being enamoured of it. Clad in yellow garments they had a quiver fastened at their back, with a cloth (of the same colour) wrapped round their waist; their hands were adorned with a graceful bow and arrow respectively. The beautiful pair, one of whom was dark and the other fair, had streaks of (red or white) sandalwood paste painted on their body so as to match the complexion. With a neck as well-built as the lion's and long arms they had on their bosom an exquisite string of pearls obtained from the forehead of elephants. Their lovely eyes resembled the red lotus; and the moon-like face relieved one of the threefold agony. Their ears were adorned with pendants of gold, which stole as it were the heart of those who looked on them. They cast a bewitching glance and had a pair of arched and shapely eyebrows; the lines of the sectarian mark on the forehead looked as if beauty had been sealed there.

Their beautiful head was covered with a charming rectangular cap and dark curly locks. The two brothers were lovely from head to foot; the beauty of every limb was as it should be.

When the citizens received the news that the two princes had come to see the town, they all left their business and ran out of their homes as if paupers were out to grab a valuable property. Beholding the natural grace of two brothers, they were glad at heart and attained the consummation of their eyes. Sticking to the air-holes of their houses young ladies lovingly scanned Śrī Rāma's beauty. They fondly spoke to one another in the following words: "O friend, He has surpassed in beauty millions of Cupids. Nowhere among gods, men, demons, Nāgas or sages do we hear of such beauty. God Viṣṇu is endowed with four arms, Brahmā has four face, while Śiva, the Slayer of Tripura, has a frightful garb and five faces. O friend, there is no other god who could stand comparison with this beauty.

#### baya kisōra suṣamā sadana syāma gaura sukha ghāma .

The two lads, one dark and the other fair, are yet of tender age and are repositories of beauty and abodes of bliss. Millions and hundreds of millions of Cupids are worth sacrificing to each one of their limbs.

Tell me, friend, what embodied being is there that would not be charmed to see such beauty?" One of them lovingly said in gentle tones, "Hear, my dear, what I have been told. These two lads, a beautiful pair of cygnets as it were, are sons of King Daśaratha; they are the protectors of Kauśika's sacrifice, and have slain demons in the field of battle. He who has a swarthy form and has charming lotus-like eyes and who has quelled the pride of Mārīca and Subāhu, wielding a bow and shaft in His hands, is Kausalyā's son, Rāma by name, the very fountain of bliss. The fair youth in gallant attire, who is closely following Śrī Rāma, a bow and arrow in hand, is the latter's younger brother and is named Lakṣmaṇa. Sumitrā, friend, is his mother, you must know.

Having accomplished the object of the Brāhmaṇa, Viśvāmitra, and redeeming the sage's wife, Ahalyā, on the way, the two brothers have come here to witness the bowsacrifice." All the ladies were delighted to hear this

Beholding Śrī Rāma's beauty someone said, "Here is a bridegroom worthy of Princess Jānakī. If the king does but see him, friend, I am sure he will abandon his vow and insist upon their marriage." Said another, "The king has come to know them and has received them as well as the sage with all honour. But the king, my dear, refuses to give up his vow and, as Fate would have it, persists in his folly." Yet another said," If providence is good and, as we are told, gives every man his due, then Jānakī is sure to have him as her bridegroom. About this, my dear, there can be no doubt. If such a union is brought about by Providence, everyone will have realized one's object. My impatience, friend, is augmented by the thought that this alliance will impel him to visit this place again.

Otherwise, my dear, it is out of question for us, I tell you, to see Him again. Such an event can take place only when we have a rich stock of merit accumulated in previous existences."

Someone else said, "Friend, you have spoken well. This union will be conducive to the best interests of all." Still another said, "Śaṅkara's bow is hard to bend, while this swarthy lad is of delicate frame. Everything, my dear, is out of place," Hearing this, another said in a soft voice, "Friend, with regard to this lad I have heard some people say that, though small in appearance, He wields a great power. Touched by the dust of His lotus-feet Ahalyā, who had perpetrated a great sin, attained salvation. He will, therefore, surely break Śiva bow; one should never commit the mistake of giving up this faith. The same Creator, who fashioned Sītā with great skill, has preordained for her this dark-complexioned bridegroom." Everyone was pleased to hear the words of this lady and softly exclaimed "Amen!"

In their gladness of heart troops of fair-faced, bright-eyed dames rained flowers on the princes. Wherever the two brothers went, there was supreme joy.

The two brothers reached the eastern quarter of the city, where the arena for the bow-sacrifice had been got ready. In the midst of a beautiful and spacious paved area a spotless altar was richly adorned. On all the four sides of this altar were erected elevated and broad seats of gold to be occupied by the princes. Not far behind and surrounding them on all sides shone another circular tier of raised seats, which was of somewhat greater height and beautiful in everyway, and where the people of the city might come and take their seat. Close to these were constructed spacious and beautiful gallaries of glistening white, painted in diverse colours, whence ladies might view the spectacle seated in their appropriate places according to their family rank. The children of the town politely showed the Lord all the preparations speaking to Him in gentle words.

#### saba sisu ēhi misa prēmabasa parasi manōhara gāta.

Thus finding an occasion for touching their charming limbs all the children were overwhelmed with love, experienced a thrill all over their body and their heart overflowed with joy on seeing the two brothers again and again.

### Chaupais

Finding all the children under the spell of affection, Śrī Rāma lovingly extolled the places shown by them. All of them would call the two brothers wherever they pleased and the two brothers went to them out of loving kindness. Śrī Rāma showed to His younger brother the arrangements that had been made there, speaking to him in soft, sweet and agreeable words. He in obedience to whose fiat Māyā brings forth multitudes of universes in the quarter of a second, the same gracious Lord, conquered by devotion, looks with amazement on the arena for the bow-sacrifice. Having seen the whole show the two brothers returned to their Guru; but the thought of their being late disturbed their mind. The Lord, whose sublimity inspires terror into Terror itself thus manifests the glory of devotion. With many kind and courteous phrases they took leave of the youngsters much against the latter's will.

#### sabhaya saprēma binīta ati sakuca sahita dōu bhāi.

Meekly and most submissively, with a mingled feeling of awe and love the two brothers bowed their head at the lotus feet of the preceptor (Viśvāmitra) and sat down with his permission.

At the approach of night the sage (Viśvāmitra) gave the word and all performed their evening devotions; and while the sage recited old legends and narratives, two watches of the beautiful night passed. The chief of the sages, Viśvāmitra, then retired to his bed; and the two brothers began to rub his feet. The couple whose lotus feet are sought by men of dispassion muttering various sacred formulae and practising different kinds of Yoga (means of union with God) lovingly rubbed the lotus-like feet of their Guru, conquered as it were by his love. When the sage asked Him again and again, the Chief of Raghu's race went to bed only then. Lakṣmaṇa pressed the Lord's feet to his bosom and caressed them with reverence and love deriving supreme joy from this service. It was only when the Lord repeatedly said, "Retire now, my brother," that he laid himself down cherishing his Brother's lotus feet in his heart.

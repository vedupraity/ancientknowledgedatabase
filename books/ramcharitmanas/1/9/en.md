Again, I bow to goddess Sarasvatī and the celestial river Gaṅgā, both of whom are holy and perform agreeable roles. The one (Gaṅgā) wipes away sin through immersion and draught; the other (Sarasvatī) dispels ignorance through the recital and hearing of her glory. I adore the great Lord Śiva and His consort Goddess Bhavānī (Pārvatī), my preceptors and parents, friends of the forlorn and ever given to charity, servants, masters and friends of Sītā's Lord, and true benefactors of Tulasīdāsa in everyway. Seeing the prevalence of the Kali age Hara and Girijā (Śiva and Pārvatī) evolved a string of spells in the tongue of savages, incoherent syllables which yield no interpretation and require no repetition, but whose efficacy is patent, revealing Śiva glory. That Lord of Umā (Pārvatī), favourable as He is to me, shall make this story of mine a source of blessings and joy. Thus invoking Lord Śiva and His Consort, Śiva (Pārvatī), and obtaining Their favour, I relate the exploits of Śrī Rāma with a heart full of ardour. By Śiva grace my composition will shed its lustre even as a night shines in conjunction with the moon and the stars. Those who will fondly and intelligently recite or hear this story with attention will develop devotion to the feet of Śrī Rāma and, purged of the impurities of Kali, will obtain choice blessings.(1-6)

##### sapanēhu sācēhu mōhi para jauṃ hara gauri pasāu.
##### tau phura hōu jō kahēu saba bhāṣā bhaniti prabhāu..15.. [1-15]

If Hara and Gaurī (Lord Śiva and Pārvatī) are really propitious to me, even in dream, let all that I have said in glorification of this poetry of mine, written in a popular dialect, come out true.(15)

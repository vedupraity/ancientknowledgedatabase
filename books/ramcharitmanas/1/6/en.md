### Salutations to all living beings as so many images of Śrī Rāma

### Chaupais

#### ākara cāri lākha caurāsī. jāti jīva jala thala nabha bāsī..
#### sīya rāmamaya saba jaga jānī. karau pranāma jōri juga pānī.. [1-7(D)-1]

#### sajjana sakṛta siṃdhu sama kōī. dēkhi pūra bidhu bāḍhai jōī.. [1-7(D)-7]

Eight million and four hundred thousand* species of living beings, classified under four broad divisions, inhabit land, water and the air. Recognizing the entire creation as full of Sītā and Rāma, I make obeisance to them with joined palms. Knowing me as your servant, be genuinely gracious to me all of you, O mines of compassion. I have no confidence in my intellectual power, hence I supplicate you all. I would recount the virtues of the Lord of Raghus,† Śrī Rāma; but my wits are poor, whereas the exploits of Śrī Rāma are unfathomable. For this I find not the least resources, while I am bankrupt of mind and intellect, my ambition is right royal. Even though my intellect is exceedingly mean, my aspiration is pitched too high; while I crave for nectar, I have no means in this world to procure even butter-milk. The virtuous will forgive my presumption and listen to my childish babbling with interest. When a child prattles in lisping accents, the parents hear it with a mind full of delight. Those, however, who are hard-hearted, mischievous and perverse and cherish others' faults as an ornament, will feel amused. Who does not like one's own poetry, be it delightful or exceedingly insipid? Such good people as delight to hear others' composition are rare in this world. The world abounds in men who resemble lakes and rivers, that get swollen with their own rise when waters are added to them. There is some rare good soul like the ocean, which swells at the sight of the full moon.(1-7)

- ***** The number of species of living beings has been categorically fixed in Hindu scriptures as eighty-four lakhs. The four broad divisions are: (1) Jarāyuja (viviparous, such as men and beasts), (2) Aṇḍaja (oviparous), (3) Svedaja (born of sweat, such as lice, bugs etc.,) and (4) Udbhijja (sprouting from the soil, viz., plants).
- **†** King Raghu was a forbear of Śrī Rāma. His descendants bore the name of Raghus. Having been the head of the clan after His father, Daśaratha, He is aptly called the Lord of the Raghus.

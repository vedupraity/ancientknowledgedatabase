Finding his heart overwhelmed with love the king recovered himself by recourse to reason and, bowing his head at the sage's feet, spoke the following pregnant words in a voice choked with emotion:-

#### kahahu nātha suṃdara dōu bālaka. munikula tilaka ki nṛpakula pālaka..
#### brahma jō nigama nēti kahi gāvā. ubhaya bēṣa dhari kī sōi āvā.. [1-215-1]
#### sahaja birāgarupa manu mōrā. thakita hōta jimi caṃda cakōrā..
#### tātē prabhu pūchau satibhāū. kahahu nātha jani karahu durāū.. [1-215-2]
#### inhahi bilōkata ati anurāgā. barabasa brahmasukhahi mana tyāgā..

#### ē priya sabahi jahāom lagi prānī. mana musukāhiṃ rāmu suni bānī..
#### raghukula mani dasaratha kē jāē. mama hita lāgi narēsa paṭhāē.. [1-215-4]

Tell me, my lord: are these two pretty boys the ornament of a sage's family or the bulwarks of some royal dynasty? Or, is it that Brahma (the Absolute), whom the Vedas describe in negative terms such as 'Not that' (Neti), has appeared in a dual form? My mind, which is dispassion itself in its natural form, is enraptured at their sight even as the Cakora bird is transported with joy at the sight of the moon. Therefore, Sir, I earnestly inquire of you: tell me the truth, my Lord; hide nothing from me. Deeply attached to them at their very sight, my mind has perforce renounced the joy of absorption into Brahma." The sage smilingly answered, "You have spoken well, O king; your words can never be untrue. Whatever living beings there are in this world, they all love these boys." Śrī Rāma smiled within Himself on hearing these words. "They are the sons of King Daśaratha, the jewel of Raghu's race; the king has sent them for my cause.

#### rāmu lakhanu dōu baṃdhubara rūpa sīla bala dhāma.
#### makha rākhēu sabu sākhi jagu jitē asura saṃgrāma..216.. [1-216]

These two noble brothers, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, are the embodiments of beauty, virtue and strength. The whole world knows that they conquered the demons in battle and protected my sacrifice from harm."

#### muni tava carana dēkhi kaha rāū. kahi na sakau nija punya prābhāū..
#### suṃdara syāma gaura dōu bhrātā. ānaomdahū kē ānaomda dātā.. [1-216-1]

#### puni puni prabhuhi citava naranāhū. pulaka gāta ura adhika uchāhū..
#### mrunihi prasaṃsi nāi pada sīsū. calēu lavāi nagara avanīsū.. [1-216-3]
#### suṃdara sadanu sukhada saba kālā. tahāom bāsu lai dīnha bhuālā..
#### kari pūjā saba bidhi sēvakāī. gayau rāu gṛha bidā karāī.. [1-216-4]

When I behold your feet, O sage, "added the king, "I cannot tell what a great merit I have earned in the past. These two brothers, one of whom is dark of hue and the other fair, are the delight of delight itself. Their guileless affection for each other is beyond description; it is so agreeable and soul-ravishing. " "Listen to me, my lord," continued King Videha rejoicing, "they have natural affinity for each other like the one existing between Brahma (the Supreme Spirit) and Jīva (the individual soul)." The king gazed upon the Lord over and over again; the hair on his body stood on end and his heart overflowed with joy. Extolling the sage and bowing his head at the latter's feet, the king escorted him to his capital, and lodged the sage in a beautiful palace which was comfortable at all times. Then, after further homage and rendering all kinds of service to him, the king took leave of the sage and returned to his own palace.

Having dined with the seers and rested awhile, Lord Śrī Rāma, the Jewel of Raghu's race, sat down by His brother's side, a quarter of the day still remained.

Lakṣmaṇa felt in his heart a great longing to go and see Janaka's capital. He was, however, afraid of the Lord and stood in awe of the sage; therefore he did not openly declare it and smiled within himself. Śrī Rāma understood what was passing in His younger brother's mind; and His heart overflowed with a kindly feeling for His devotee. Taking leave of His preceptor to speak, He smilingly spoke with much diffidence in most polite terms," My lord, Lakṣmaṇa longs to see the city, but out of fear and respect for you he does not make it known to you. If I have your permission, I will take him round the city and quickly bring him back." Hearing this the chief of sages, Viśvāmitra, replied in affectionate terms, "It is no wonder, Rāma, that You should respect good manners. You are the upholder of the moral code, my son, and bring joy to Your servants out of love for them

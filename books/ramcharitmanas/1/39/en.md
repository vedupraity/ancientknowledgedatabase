The Lord, who is all-pervading, indivisible, desireless, unbegotten, attributeless and without name or form, performed marvellous acts of various kinds for the sake of His devotees.

All this story has been sung by me; now hear attentively what followed. The great enlightened hermit Viśvāmitra lived in a forest knowing it to be a sacred spot. There he practised Japa (muttering of sacred formulas) and Yoga (contemplation) and performed sacrifices; but he was much afraid of the demons Mārīca and Subāhu. For as soon as they saw a sacrifice they would hasten to desecrate it to the great chagrin of the sage, who felt disturbed in his mind and thought that the wicked Rākṣasas could not be disposed of without Śrī Hari. The great sage then said to himself, "The Lord has already taken birth in order to relieve the earth of its burden. Let me make the outrage of the demons an excuse of seeing His feet and after due entreaty bring the two brothers here. I will regale my eyes with the sight of Him who is the abode of knowledge, dispassion and all virtues."

Indulging in expectation of various kinds the sage took no time in reaching his destination. Bathing in the stream of the Sarayū he proceeded to the royal court. (206)

When the king heard of the sage's visit he went out to meet him with a party of Brāhmaṇas. Prostrating himself on the ground the king reverently brought him in and seated him on his own throne. Then, washing the sage's feet, he paid him great honours and said, "No one else is so blessed as I am today." The king next entertained him with various kinds of food and the great sage was much delighted at heart. He then placed his four sons on the latter's feet. At the sight of Śrī Rāma the sage forgot all about himself. He was enraptured as he gazed on the beauty of Śrī Rāma's countenance even as the Cakora bird is enamoured of the full moon. Gladdened at heart, the king then addressed the following words to him, "Reverend sir, you have never shown such grace to me before. Tell me what brings you here; I will carry out your order without delay." "Hosts of demons molest me, O king; I have therefore come to ask something of you. Let me have the Lord of Raghus, Śrī Rāma, with His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa); with the extermination of the demons I will feel secure."

Hearing this most unwelcome demand the king's heart quivered and the brightness of his countenance faded. He said, "I have been blessed with these four sons in my old age. You have, therefore, made your demand without due consideration, holy sir. Ask of me land, cattle, goods and treasure; I will gladly give all I have without delay. Nothing is dearer than one's body and life; even these I would part within a second. All my sons are dear to me as life; but in no case can I afford to spare Rāma, my lord. My lovely boys, who are yet too young, are no match for the most hideous and relentless demons." The enlightened hermit Viśvāmitra felt delighted at heart to hear the king's reply, steeped as it was in the nectar of love. Then Vasiṣṭha pleaded with the king in manifold ways and all his doubts were gone. Most politely he sent for the two boys and pressing them to his bosom admonished them in many ways. Turning to the sage he then said, "My lord, the two boys are my very life. You are their only father now, holy sir; there is no one to look after them."

Invoking various blessings on the boys the king committed them to the care of the sage; then they called at the mother's apartment and bowing their head at her feet departed. The two heroes, lions among men, oceans of compassion, resolute of purpose and the ultimate cause of the whole universe, gladly proceeded to rid the sage of his fear.

The Lord had reddish eyes, a broad chest and long arms; His body was dark as the blue lotus or the Tamāla tree. With a beautiful quiver fastened at His back with a yellow piece of cloth wrapped round His waist, He held in His two hands a lovely bow and arrow respectively. In the two pretty boys, one of whom was dark and the other fair, Viśvāmitra secured a great treasure. "I have now realized," said he to himself, "that the Lord is a votary of the Brāhmaṇas; on my account He has left His own father." While on the way the sage pointed out the demoness Tāḍakā, who on hearing their voice rushed up in a fury. With a single shaft the Lord took her life and recognizing her as deserving of compassion bestowed His own state on her. Then the seer Viśvāmitra, while recognizing his lord as the fountain of knowledge, imparted to Him a sacred formula which armed Him against hunger and thirst and endowed Him with unequalled strength of body and a glow of vigour.

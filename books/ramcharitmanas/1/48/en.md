Finding it an appropriate occasion Janaka then sent for Sītā; and Her companions, all lovely and accomplished, escorted Her with due honour.

Sītā's beauty defies all description, Mother of the universe that She is and an embodiment of charm and excellence. All comparisons seem to me too poor; for they have affinity with the limbs of mortal women. Proceeding to depict Sītā with the help of those very similes why should one earn the title of an unworthy poet and court ill-repute? Should Sītā be likened to any woman of this material creation, where in this world shall one come across such a lovely damsel? The goddess of speech (Sarasvatī), for instance, is a chatterer; while Bhavānī possesses only half a body (the other half being represented by her lord, Śiva). And Rati (Love's consort) is extremely distressed by the thought of her husband being without a form. And it is quite out of the question to compare Videha's Daughter with Rāma, who has poison and spirituous liquor for her dear brothers. Supposing there was an ocean of nectar in the form of loveliness and the tortoise serving as a base for churning it was an embodiment of consummate beauty, and if splendour itself were to take the form of a cord, the erotic sentiment should crystallize and assume the shape of Mount Mandara and the god of love himself were to churn this ocean with his own hands-

##### tadapi sakōca samēta kabi kahahiṃ sīya samatūla..247.. [1-247]

And if from such churning were to be born a Lakṣmī, who was the source of all loveliness and joy, the poet would even then hesitatingly declare her as analogous to Sītā.

Sītā's clever companions escorted Her to the arena, singing songs in a charming voice. A beautiful Sāri (covering for the body) adorned Her youthful frame; the Mother of the universe was incomparable in her exquisite beauty. Ornaments of all kinds had been beautifully set in their appropriate places, each limb having been decked by Her companions with great care. When Sītā stepped into the arena, men and women alike were fascinated by Her charms. The gods gladly sounded their kettledrums, while celestial damsels rained down flowers in the midst of songs. In Her lotus-like hands sparkled the wreath of victory, as She cast a hurried glance at all the princes. While Sītā looked for Śrī Rāma with anxious heart, all the princes found themselves in the grip of infatuation. Presently Sītā discovered the two brothers by the side of the sage, and Her eyes greedily fell on them as on a long-lost treasure.

Out of natural bashfulness that She felt in the presence of elders and at the sight of the vast assemblage, Sītā shrank into Herself; and drawing the Hero of Raghu's race into Her heart She turned Her eyes towards Her companions.

Beholding Śrī Rāma's beauty and Sītā's loveliness men and women alike forgot to close their eyelids. All of them felt anxious in their heart but hesitated to speak; they inwardly prayed to the Creator, "Quickly take away, O Creator, Janaka's stupidity and give him right understanding like ours, so that the king without the least scruple may abandon his vow and give Sītā in marriage to Rāma. The world will speak well of him and the idea will find favour with all. On the other hand, if he persists in his folly, he shall have to rue it in the end. Everyone is absorbed in the ardent feeling that the dark-complexioned youth is a suitable match for Janaka's daughter." Then Janaka summoned the heralds, and they came eulogizing his race. The king said, "Go round and proclaim my vow." Forthwith they proceeded on their mission; there was not a little joy in their heart.

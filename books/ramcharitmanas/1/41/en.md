At the very touch of His holy feet, which drive away sorrow, emerged Ahalyā, a true embodiment of austerity. Beholding the Lord of Raghus, the delight of His servants, she stood before Him with joined palms. Her heart being overwhelmed with love, the hair on her body stood on their end and she was unable to utter a word. The most blessed Ahalyā cleaved to His feet and tears streamed from both her eyes. Recovering herself she recognized the Lord and by the grace of Śrī Rāma attained devotion to His feet. In a guileless speech she began to praise the Lord, "Glory to the Lord of Raghus, who is accessible through spiritual knowledge. I am an impure woman, while the Lord is able to sanctify the whole world and is the delight of His servants. O lotus-eyed enemy of Rāvaṇa, You rid Your devotees of the fear of rebirth; therefore, I have taken refuge in You. Pray save me, save me. My consort (Gautama) did well in pronouncing a curse on me, and I have deemed it the greatest favour. I have feasted my eyes on Śrī Hari (Yourself), who liberated from the bondage of worldly existence. Lord Śaṅkara deems Your sight as the only blessing worth the name. Lord, I am very innocent of heart; I have only one request to make. I seek no other boon from You, my Master; I only crave that my mind may ever continue to enjoy the love of Your feet-dust even as a bee sucks the honey from a lotus. The merciful Lord Śrī Hari placed on my head the same lotus feet from which issued the most holy Gaṅgā (the heavenly river)-which is borne by Śiva on His head-and which are adored by Brahmā (the Creator)." Having thus praised Śrī Hari and falling again and again at His feet Gautama's consort (Ahalyā) took leave of the Lord; and securing a boon, which she held most dear to her heart, she went to her husband's abode full of joy

#### Dohas

##### asa prabhu dīnabaṃdhu hari kārana rahita dayāla.
##### tulasidāsa saṭha tēhi bhaju chāḍai kapaṭa jaṃjāla..211.. [1-211]

The Lord Śrī Hari is such a great friend of the humble and compassionate beyond one's deserts. Adore Him, O foolish Tulasīdāsa, giving up all deceit and wily wrangling.

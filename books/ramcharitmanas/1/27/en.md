### Śiva's nuptials

### Dohas

#### muni anusāsana ganapatihi pūjēu saṃbhu bhavāni.
#### kōu suni saṃsaya karai jani sura anādi jiyaom jāni..100.. [1-100]

At the direction of the sages Śambhu and Bhavānī paid divine honours to Lord Gaṇapati. Let no one be puzzled to hear this; for one should bear in mind that gods have existed from time without beginning.*

- ***** Lord Gaṇapati is reputed to be an offspring of Śiva and Pārvatī. It may, therefore, be asked how He came to be worshipped by the divine pair even at the time of their wedding. The poet meets this question by stating that Gaṇeśa and the other gods are eternal and unbegotten and that they only appear to be born.

The great sages had the nuptial ceremony performed in all its details as laid down in the Vedas. Taking sacred Kuśa grass in his hand and holding the bride by Her hand, the mountain-king Himālaya made Her over to Bhava (Śiva) knowing Her to be His eternal consort. When the great Lord Śiva took the hand of the bride, all the great gods were glad at heart. The principal sages chanted the Vedic formulas, while the gods exclaimed, "Victory, victory, all victory to Śaṅkara !" Musical instruments of various kinds were sounded and flowers of different varieties were rained down from the heavens. The wedding of Hara and Girijā was thus concluded. A spirit of rejoicing pervaded the whole universe. Men-servants and maid-servants, horses and chariots, elephants and cows, raiment, jewels and various other articles and even so cart-loads of foodgrains and gold utensils were given as dowry, which was more than one could describe.

#### sivaom kṛpāsāgara sasura kara saṃtōṣu saba bhāomtihiṃ kiyō.
#### puni gahē pada pāthōja mayanāom prēma paripūrana hiyō..

Himācala gave presents of various kinds as dowry; then, joining his palms, he said, "I have nothing to give you, Śaṅkara; You have all Yours desires sated!" He could say no more and remained clasping the latter's feet. The ocean of mercy that Śiva is reassured His father-in-law in every possible way. Then Menā, with her heart overflowing with love, clasped His lotus-feet and said:-

### Dohas

#### nātha umā mana prāna sama gṛhakiṃkarī karēhu.
#### chamēhu sakala aparādha aba hōi prasanna baru dēhu..101.. [1-101]

Lord, Umā is dear to me as life; take her as a maid-servant of Your house and forgive all her faults. Be pleased to grant this boon to me.

#### puni puni milati parati gahi caranā. parama prēma kachu jāi na baranā..
#### saba nārinha mili bhēṭi bhavānī. jāi janani ura puni lapaṭānī.. [1-101-4]

Śambhu comforted His mother-in-law in ways more than one; and she returned home bowing her head at his feet. The mother then sent for Umā, and taking Her into her lap gave Her the following excellent advice. "Ever adore the feet of Śaṅkara this sums up the duty of a wife. Her husband is her deity; there is no other god for her." As she spoke these words, her eyes filled with tears and she pressed the girl to her bosom. "Why has god created woman in this world? One who is dependent on others can never dream of happiness." The mother was overwhelmed with emotion; but knowing as she did that it was not an opportune moment for betraying one's weakness, she recovered herself. Mainā met Pārvatī again and again and fell down clasping the girl's feet; her supreme love was beyond all words. Bidding adieu to all the ladies Bhavānī ran and clung to her mother's breast once more.

#### jananihi bahuri mili calī ucita asīsa saba kāhūom daīṃ.

#### saba amara haraṣē sumana baraṣi nisāna nabha bājē bhalē..

Taking leave of Her mother once more, Bhavānī departed; everyone uttered appropriate blessings to Her. She often turned back to have a look at Her mother; Her girl companions then took Her to Śiva. Having gratified all beggars. Śaṅkara proceeded to His home (Mount Kailāsa) with Umā. All the divinities delightfully rained down flowers and kettledrums produced a charming sound in the heavens.

### Dohas

#### calē saṃga himavaṃtu taba pahucāvana ati hētu.

Himavān then accompanied Śiva in order to escort Him with great affection. Śiva, however, sent him back, consoling him in various ways.

The mountain-king returned home at once and summoned all other mountains and lakes. Himavān greeted them with due attention, gifts, polite words and great honour and allowed them all to depart. No sooner had Śambhu reached Mount Kailāsa than all the gods returned to their respective realms. Śambhu and Bhavānī are the parents of the universe; hence I refrain from portraying their amorous sports. Indulging in luxuries and enjoyments of various kinds the divine pair lived on Mount Kailāsa alongwith Their attendants. Hara and Girijā enjoyed some new delight everyday. In this way a considerable time elapsed. Thereafter was born to them a boy with six heads, who (later on) killed the demon Tāraka in battle. The story of Ṣaṇmukha (the six-headed deity) is well-known in the Vedas, Tantras and Purāṇas, and the entire world knows it.

### Chhands

#### jagu jāna ṣanmukha janmu karmu pratāpu puruṣārathu mahā.

#### yaha umā saṃgu bibāhu jē nara nāri kahahiṃ jē gāvahīṃ.
#### kalyāna kāja bibāha maṃgala sarbadā sukhu pāvahīṃ..

The tale of the birth, exploits, glory and surpassing strength of Ṣaṇmukha is known to the whole world. That is why I have briefly touched the narrative of Śiva son. Men and women who narrate or sing this story of the wedding of Umā and Śambhu shall ever rejoice in their auspicious undertaking as well as during festive occassions such as wedding etc.

#### carita siṃdhu girijā ramana bēda na pāvahiṃ pāru.

The exploits of Girijā's lord are illimitable like the ocean; even the Vedas cannot reach their end. How, then, can Tulasīdāsa, a most dull-witted clown, succeed in describing them?

Bharadvāja was much delighted to hear the sweet and charming story of Śambhu's deeds. His passion for hearing the story grew to be inordinate; tears rushed to his eyes and the hair on his body bristled with joy. Overpowered with emotion he could not utter a word. The enlightened sage Yājñāvalkya was delighted to see his condition. "Blessed indeed is your birth. O great sage," he said, "to you the Lord of Gaurī is dear as life. Those who love not Śiva lotus feet cannot even dream of pleasing Rāma. A guileless love for Śiva feet is the surest sign of a devotee of Rāma. Who is so faithful to the Lord of Raghus as Śiva, who renounced a sinless wife like Sati, and demonstrated ideal devotion to Rāma by His pledge of unswerving fidelity? Brother, whom does Rāma hold so dear as Śiva?

#### prathamahiṃ mai kahi siva carita būjhā maramu tumhāra.

"Having begun by recounting the deeds of Śiva I have come to know your secret. You are indeed a faithful servant of Rāma, free from all impurities."

I have come to know your virtues and disposition. Listen, therefore, while I narrate the story of the Lord of Raghus. O sage, I cannot say how glad I am at this meeting with you today. O lord of sages, the exploits of Śrī Rāma are much beyond measure; even a thousand million Śeṣas (serpent-kings) cannot recount them. Nevertheless, fixing my thoughts on the Lord who wields a bow in His hand and is the lord of speech, I repeat the tale as I have heard it. Śāradā (the goddess of speech) is like a puppet; while Śrī Rāma, the inner controller of all, is the master of the puppet show, who holds the strings in his hands. When He blesses a poet knowing him to be a devotee, He causes the goddess to dance in the courtyard of his heart. To Him, the benevolent Lord of Raghus, I bow and commence the recital of His fair virtues. Of all mountains the most charming and the best is Kailāsa, where Śiva and Umā eternally dwell.

Hosts of Siddhas (adepts) ascetics and Yogīs (mystics), as well as gods, Kiṁnaras and sages, all lucky souls, reside there and adore Śiva, the root of all joy.

Those who have their faces turned away from Hari and Hara and have no love for righteousness cannot even dream of going there. On the summit of that mountain exists a huge banyan tree, which is ever young and is charming during all seasons. Fanned by cool, soft and fragrant breezes, its shade is very refreshing. It is the favourite resort of Śiva, extolled by the Vedas. Once upon a time the Lord betook Himself beneath the tree and was much gladdened at heart to see it. Spreading His tigerskin on the ground with His own hands, the all-merciful Śiva sat down casually. His body fair in hue as the jasmine, the moon and the conch-shell; arms of inordinate length; a hermit's covering, consisting of the bark of trees, wrapped round His loins; His feet resembling a pair of full-blown red lotuses and their toe-nails shedding a lustre which dispelled the darkness of the devotee's heart; serpents and the ashes serving as ornaments of the Slayer of Tripura and His countenance eclipsing the splendour even of the autumnal full moon.

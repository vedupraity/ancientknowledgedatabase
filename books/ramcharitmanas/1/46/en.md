Under pretence of looking at a deer, bird or tree She turned again and again; and each time She gazed on the beauteous Hero of Raghu's race, Her love waxed not a little. (234)

Drooping at the thought of the unyielding bow of Śiva, She proceeded with the image of the swarthy form in Her heart. When the Lord perceived that Janaka's Daughter, a fountain of bliss, affection, grace and goodness, was going, He sketched Her on the sheet of His heart with the soft ink of supreme love. Sītā then sought Bhavānī's temple and, adoring Her feet, prayed to Her with joined palms: "Glory, all glory to You, O Daughter of the mountain-king ! Glory to You, who gaze on the countenance of the great Lord Śiva as a Cakora bird on the moon. Glory to You, O Mother of the elephant-headed Gaṇeśa and the six-faced Kārtikeya and mother of the universe with limbs shining as lightning. You have no beginning, middle or end; Your infinite glory is a mystery even to the Vedas. You are responsible for the birth, maintenance and destruction of the universe; You enchant the whole universe and carry on Your sports independently of others.

"The fourfold rewards of life (viz., religious merit, worldly riches, sensuous enjoyment and Liberation) are easily attainable through Your service, O bestower of boons, beloved of Śiva (the Slayer of Tripura)! All who adore Your lotus feet, O Shining One, attain happiness, be they gods, men or sages. You know well my heart's longing since You ever dwell in the town of every heart. That is why I have refrained from openly declaring it." With these words Videha's Daughter clasped the feet of the image. Bhavānī was overcome by Her meekness and devotion; the wreath on the image dropped and the idol smiled. Sītā reverently placed the divine gift on Her head. Gaurī's heart was filled with delight while She spoke, "Hear, Sītā, my infallible blessing: Your heart's desire shall be accomplished. Nārada's words are ever faultless and true; the suitor on whom Your heart is set shall, indeed, be Yours.

##### ēhi bhāomti gauri asīsa suni siya sahita hiyaom haraṣīṃ alī.
##### tulasī bhavānihi pūji puni puni mudita mana maṃdira calī..

"The dark-complexioned and naturally handsome suitor of whom You are enamoured shall, indeed, be Yours. The gracious and omniscient Lord is aware of your fidelity and love." Sītā and all Her companions were delighted at heart to hear this blessing from Gaurī's lips. Worshipping Goddess Bhavānī again and again Sītā, says Tulasīdāsa, returned to Her abode, rejoicing in Her heart.

Finding Gaurī favourably disposed towards Her, Sītā was more glad of heart than words can tell. Her left limbs began to throb, indicating Her good fortune

Inwardly praising Sītā's beauty, the two brothers returned to their Guru (Viśvāmitra). Śrī Rāma related everything to Kauśika; for He was innocent of heart and free from all guile. Having got the flowers the sage performed his devotions and then blessed the two brothers, saying, "May your heart's desire be accomplished." Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were glad to hear the benediction. After finishing his meals the great and illumined hermit, Viśvāmitra, began to recite old legends. The day was thus spent; and obtaining the Guru's permission the two brothers proceeded to say their evening prayers. In the meantime the charming moon rose in the eastern horizon; perceiving that her orb resembled Sītā's face Śrī Rāma felt happy. The Lord then reasoned within Himself. The queen of night bears no resemblance to Sītā.

##### janamu siṃdhu puni baṃdhu biṣu dina malīna sakalaṃka.
##### siya mukha samatā pāva kimi caṃdu bāpurō raṃka..237.. [1-237]

"Born of the ocean (with its salt water), with poison for her brother, dim and obscure by the day and with a dark spot in her orb, how can the poor and wretched moon be matched with Sītā's countenance ?*"

- ***** The moon is one of the fourteen jewels (treasures of the world) that were churned out of the ocean by the joint efforts of the gods and demons at the dawn of creation. It is to this Paurāṇika legend that the Lord refers to above. The very first product of this churning was poison, which was swallowed by Lord Śiva. It is in this sense that the moon is spoken of as having poison for a brother.

Again, the moon waxes and wanes; she is the curse of lovesick damsels and is devoured by Rāhu when she crosses the latter's orbit. She causes anguish to the Cakravāka (the ruddy goose) and withers the lotus. O moon, there are numerous faults in you. One would incur the blame of having done a highly improper act by comparing you with the countenance of Videha's daughter." Thus finding in the moon a pretext for extolling the beauty of Sītā's countenance and perceiving that the night had far advanced, Śrī Rāma returned to His Guru; and bowing at the sage's lotus feet and receiving his permission He retired to rest. At the close of night the Lord of Raghus woke; and looking towards His brother He began to speak thus, ''Lo, brother, the day has dawned to the delight of the lotus, the Cakravāka and the whole world." Joining both of his palms Lakṣmaṇa gently spoke the following words indicative of the Lord's glory:-

The day having dawned, the lily has faded and the brightness of the stars is dimmed, just as at the news of Your arrival all the princes (assembled here) have grown faint."

"Though twinkling like stars, all the princes put together are unable to lift the thick darkness in the form of the bow. And just as lotuses and bees and the Cakravāka and various other birds rejoice over the termination of night, even so, my lord, all Your devotees will be glad when the bow is broken. Lo, the sun is up and the darkness has automatically disappeared; the stars have vanished out of sight and light flashes upon the world. Under pretence of its rising, O Lord of Raghus, the sun has demonstrated to all the princes the glory of my lord (Yourself). It is in order to reveal the might of Your arms that the process of breaking the bow has been set into operation." The Lord smiled at these remarks of His brother. He who is pure by His very nature then performed the daily acts of purification and bathed, and after finishing the daily routine of prayer etc., called on His Guru and the two brothers bowed their graceful heads at his lotus feet. Meanwhile King Janaka summoned his preceptor Śatānanda and sent him at once to the sage Kauśika. Śatānanda communicated to Viśvāmitra Janaka's humble submission and Viśvāmitra gladly sent for the two brothers.

Adoring Śatānanda's feet the Lord went and sat down by His Guru; the sage then said, "Come on, my son: Janaka has sent for us."

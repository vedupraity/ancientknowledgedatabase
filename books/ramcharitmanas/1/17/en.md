#### Disowning of Sati by Śiva and Śiva's trance

#### Dohas

##### parama punīta na jāi taji kiēom prēma baḍa pāpu.
##### pragaṭi na kahata mahēsu kachu hṛdayaom adhika saṃtāpu..56.. [1-56]

"Satī is too chaste to be abandoned, and it is a great sin to love her any more as a wife." The great Lord Śiva uttered not a word aloud, although there was great agony in His heart. (56)

##### jadapi satīṃ pūchā bahu bhāomtī. tadapi na kahēu tripura ārātī.. [1-56-4]

Then Śaṅkara bowed His head at the feet of the Lord; and as soon as He invoked Śrī Rāma the idea came to His mind that He should have no connection with Satī so long as she continued to remain in that body. Śiva resolved accordingly and having so resolved the stable-minded Lord Śaṅkara proceeded towards His home (Mount Kailāsa) with His mind fixed on the Hero of Raghu's race. Even as He stepped forward a charming voice from heaven thundered forth. "Glory to the great Lord Śiva, who has so staunchly upheld the cause of Devotion. Who else than You can take such a vow? You are a devotee of Śrī Rāma and the all-powerful Lord at the same time." Satī felt troubled at heart when She heard the heavenly voice. She addressed Śiva in a faltering voice, "Tell me, O merciful Lord! what vow You have taken. You are an embodiment of Truth and compassionate to the poor." Even though Satī inquired in ways more than one, the Slayer of the demon Tripura, Śaṅkara spoke not a word. (1-4)

##### satīṃ hṛdaya anumāna kiya sabu jānēu sarbagya.

##### bilaga hōi rasu jāi kapaṭa khaṭāī parata puni..57kha.. [1-57(A)-57(B)]

Satī concluded that the omniscient Lord had come to know everything and felt sorry that She had tried to deceive Śambhu. The woman is silly and stupid by nature, She realized. (57A) Even water (when mixed with milk) sells as milk; look at the unifying process of love. The water, however, is separated from the milk and the taste also disappears the moment a drop of acid is introduced into it in the form of a dees. (57B)

Satī felt perturbed in Her heart at the thought of what She had done; and the extent of Her anxiety could neither be gauged nor described. She realized that Lord Śiva is a supremely unfathomable ocean of mercy, hence He did not openly declare Her fault. From the attitude of Śaṅkara, however, She judged that the Lord had abandoned Her, and felt disturbed in Her heart. Conscious of Her guilt She could not utter a word of protest; but all the while Her heart smouldered like a furnace. Perceiving the sad look of Satī, Śiva (who has a bull emblazoned on His standard) narrated beautiful stories in order to divert Her mind. Relating various legends while on His way, the Lord of the universe, Śiva, reached Kailāsa. Then, recalling His vow, Śambhu sat down there under a banyan tree in the Yogic pose known as Padmāsana (the pose of a lotus). Śaṅkara communed with His own Self and passed into an unbroken and indefinitely long Samādhi (trance). (1-4)

##### satī basahi kailāsa taba adhika sōcu mana māhiṃ.
##### maramu na kōū jāna kachu juga sama divasa sirāhiṃ..58.. [1-58]

Then Satī dwelt in Kailāsa, Her mind grievously sorrowing. Nobody knew anything about what was going on in Her mind; but the days hung heavy on Her like so many Yugas or ages. (58)

##### nita nava sōcu satīṃ ura bhārā. kaba jaihau dukha sāgara pārā..
##### maiṃ jō kīnha raghupati apamānā. punipati bacanu mṛṣā kari jānā.. [1-58-1]
##### sō phalu mōhi bidhātāom dīnhā. jō kachu ucita rahā sōi kīnhā..
##### aba bidhi asa būjhia nahi tōhī. saṃkara bimukha jiāvasi mōhī.. [1-58-2]
##### kahi na jāī kachu hṛdaya galānī. mana mahu rāmāhi sumira sayānī..
##### jau prabhu dīnadayālu kahāvā. āratī harana bēda jasu gāvā.. [1-58-3]
##### tau maiṃ binaya karau kara jōrī. chūṭau bēgi dēha yaha mōrī..
##### jauṃ mōrē siva carana sanēhū. mana krama bacana satya bratu ēhū.. [1-58-4]

The grief that preyed on Satī's mind was ever new; for She did not know when She would be able to cross the ocean of sorrow. "I slighted the Lord of Raghus and again took my husband's words to be untrue; Providence has repaid me for my sins and has done only that which I deserved. Now, O God, it does not behove you that you should make me survive even after alienating me from Śaṅkara." The anguish of Her heart was beyond words. The sane lady invoked the presence of Rāma in Her heart and addressed Him thus; "If they refer to You as compassionate to the poor and if the Vedas have glorified You as the dispeller of sorrow, I beseech with joined palms. O Lord, that I may be speedily rid of this body of mine. If I have any devotion to the feet of Śiva and if I am true to my vow in thought, word and deed- (1-4)

##### tau sabadarasī sunia prabhu karau sō bēgi upāi.

"Then, O all-perceiving Lord, listen to me and speedily devise some plan whereby I may die and be thus rid of this unbearable calamity without much exertion." (59)

The daughter of Dakṣa, Satī, thus felt very miserable. Her deep agony was terrible beyond words. When eighty-seven thousand years elapsed, the immortal Śambhu emerged from His trance. Śiva started repeating the name of Rāma; then Satī came to know that the Lord of the universe had come to the waking state. She went and bowed at the feet of Śambhu, Śaṅkara gave Her a seat opposite Himself. He began to narrate the delightful stories of Śrī Hari. Meanwhile Dakṣa (Satī's father) had come to be the lord of created beings. On careful consideration the Creator (Brahmā) found Dakṣa qualified in everyway and appointed him as the supreme lord of created beings. When Dakṣa attained this high position, the pride of his heart knew no bounds. Never was a creature born in this world, whom power did not intoxicate. (1-4)

#### Ego's sway over Nārada and the effect of the Lord's Māyā

#### Dohas

##### saṃbhu dīnha upadēsa hita nahiṃ nāradahi sōhāna.
##### bhāradvāja kautuka sunahu hari icchā balavāna..127.. [1-127]

Wholesome was the advice given by Śambhu; but it did not please Nārada. Bharadvāja, now hear what interesting thing happened. The will of Hari is predominant.

##### ati pracamda raghupati kai māyā, jehi na moha asa ko jaga jāyā [1-127-4]

The will of Śrī Rāma alone prevails; there is no one who can alter it. Śambhu's advice fell flat on the sage. Then he went to the abode of Brahmā (the Creator). Singing the glories of Śrī Hari, to the accompaniment of the excellent lute he had in his hand, the lord of sages, Nārada, who was skilled in music, once repaired to the ocean of milk. Where dwells the abode of Lakṣmī, Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa, who is Vedānta (the crown of all Vedas) personified. The abode of Rāma (Lakṣmī) rose to meet him in great joy and shared His seat with the sage. The Lord of the entire creation, animate as well as inanimate, said with a smile, "It is after a long time that you have showed Me this favour, reverend sir." Nārada told Him all the doings of Love, even though Śiva had already forbidden him to do so. Most formidable is the Māyā (deluding potency) of the Lord of Raghus. No one was ever born in this world, who is beyond its charm.

##### rūkha badana kari bacana mṛdu bōlē śrībhagavāna .
##### tumharē sumirana tēṃ miṭahiṃ mōha māra mada māna..128.. [1-128]

With an impassive look, yet in coaxing accents, said the Lord, "By your very thought self-delusion, lust, arrogance and pride disappear."

##### sunu muni mōha hōi mana tākēṃ. gyāna birāga hṛdaya nahiṃ jākē..

##### taba nārada hari pada sira nāī. calē hṛdayaom ahamiti adhikāī..
##### śrīpati nija māyā taba prērī. sunahu kaṭhina karanī tēhi kērī.. [1-128-4]

"Hark, O sage! the mind of him alone is susceptible to delusion, whose heart is devoid of wisdom and dispassion. You are steadfast in your vow of celibacy and resolute of mind; you can never be smitten with pangs of Love." Nārada replied with a feeling of pride, "Lord it is all due to Your grace." The compassionate Lord pondered and saw that a huge tree of pride had sprouted in his heart. "I shall soon tear it up by roots; for it is My vow to serve the best interest of My servants. I must contrive some plan which may do good to the sage and serve as a diversion for Me." Then, bowing his head at the feet of Śrī Hari, Nārada departed. The pride in his heart had swelled. The Lord of Lakṣmī (the goddess of prosperity) then set His Māyā into operation. Now hear of her relentless doings.

The Lord's Māyā (deluding potency) created on the way a city with an area of eight hundred square miles. The manifold architectural beauties of that city excelled even those of Viṣṇu's own capital (Vaikuṇṭha).

It was inhabited by graceful men and women, whom you would take to be so many incarnations of the god of love and his wife Rati. A king, Śīlanidhi by name, ruled over that city; he owned numberless horses, elephants and troops. He possessed the grandeur and luxury of a hundred Indras, and was a repository of grace, splendour, might and wisdom. He had a daughter, Viśvamohinī by name, whose beauty enraptured even Lakṣmī. She was no other than Śrī Hari's own Māyā (enrapturing potency), the fountainhead of all virtues; who can describe her charm? The princess was going to marry by self-choice; hence kings beyond number arrived there as suitors. The sportive sage (Nārada) entered the city and inquired everything from the people. Hearing all that had been going on there, he wended his way to the king's palace. The king paid him homage and gave him a seat.

##### kapihi bilōki dasānana bihasā kahi durbāda.
##### suta badha surati kīnhi puni upajā hṛdayaom biṣāda [5-20]

When the ten-headed monster saw the monkey he laughed and railed at him. But presently he recalled his son's death and felt sad at heart.

Said the king of Laṅkā, "Who are you, monkey, and by whose might have you wrought the destruction of the grove? What, did you never hear my name? I see you are an exceptionally bold wretch. For what offence did you kill the demons? Tell me, fool, are you not afraid of losing your life?" "Listen, Rāvaṇa: recall Him by whose might Māyā (Nature) brings forth numberless universes; by whose might, O ten-headed monster, Brahma, Hari (Viṣṇu) and ∫sa (Śiva) carry on their respective function of creation, preservation and destruction; by whose might the thousand-headed serpent (Śeṣa) supports on his head the entire globe with its mountains and forests, who assumes various forms in order to protect the gods and teach a lesson to wretches like you; who broke Śiva unbending bow and crushed with it the pride of a host of princes; who despatched Khara, Dūṣaṇa, Triśirā and Vāli, all unequalled in strength.

"I am aware of your glory: you had an encounter with Sahasrabāhu* and won distinction in your contest with Vāli.†" Rāvaṇa heard the words of Hanumān but laughed them away. "I ate the fruit because I felt hungry and broke the boughs as a monkey is wont to do. One's body, my master, is supremely dear to all; yet those wicked fellows would insist on belabouring me, so that I had no course left but to return their blows. Still your son (Meghanāda) put me in bonds; but I am not at all ashamed of being bound, keen as I am to serve the cause of my lord. I implore you with joined palms, Rāvaṇa: give up your haughtiness and heed my advice. Think of your lineage and view things in that perspective; in any case disillusion yourself and adore Him who dispels the fear of His devotees. Never antagonize Him who is a source of terror even to Death, that devours all created beings, both animate and inanimate, gods as well as demons. And return Janaka's Daughter at my request

- ***** (Vide Laṅkā-Kāṇḍa 23, 8)
- **†** Once upon a time, when Vāli was performing his Sandhyā, Rāvaṇa sought to capture him by stealing behind him. Vāli, however, got scent of his mischievous intention; and the moment Rāvaṇa approached Vāli the latter caught hold of him and held him secure in his arm-pit till he had finished his Sandhyā and Tarpaṇa (offering water to the manes). Rāvaṇa remained in that position for six months till at last Brahmā himself came to his rescue and secured his release.

##### pranatapāla raghunāyaka karunā siṃdhu kharāri.
##### gaēom sarana prabhu rākhihaiṃ tava aparādha bisāri [5-22]

Lord Śrī Rāma, the Slayer of Khara, is a protector of the suppliant and an ocean of compassion. Forgetting your offences, He will give you shelter if you but turn to Him for protection

"Install the image of Śrī Rāma's lotus feet in your heart and enjoy the uninterrupted sovereignty of Laṅkā. The glory of the sage Pulastya (your grandfather) shines like the moon without its spot; be not a speck in that moon. Speech is charmless without Śrī Rāma's name. Ponder and see for yourself, casting aside arrogance and infatuation. A fair lady without clothes, O enemy of gods, does not commend herself even though adorned with all kinds of jewels. The fortune and lordship of a man who is hostile to Rāma eventually leave him even if they stay a while, and are as good as lost if acquired anew. Rivers that have no perennial source get dried up as soon as the rains are over. Listen, O ten-headed Rāvaṇa, I tell you on oath: there is none to save him who is opposed to Śrī Rāma. Śaṅkara, Viṣṇu and Brahmā* in their thousands are unable to protect you, an enemy of Śrī Rāma."

- ***** Brahmā,Viṣṇu and Śiva are spoken of here as part manifestations of the Supreme Deity, responsible for the creation etc., of only one of the countless millions of universes ruled over by Śrī Rāma, who represents the Supreme Deity.

Although Hanumān gave him exceedingly salutary advice, full of devotion, discretion, dispassion and wisdom, the most haughty Rāvaṇa laughed and said, "We have found a most wise Guru in this monkey ! (Turning towards Hanumān he continued) Death hangs over your head, O wretch; that is why you have started exhorting me, O vile monkey." "Just the contrary is going to happen;" retorted Hanumān. "I clearly perceive that you are labouring under some mental illusion." Hearing these words of Hanumān Rāvaṇa got nettled. "Why not some of you quickly kill this fool?" As soon as the demons heard it, they rushed forward to kill him. That very moment came Vibhīṣaṇa (Rāvaṇa's youngest brother) with his counsellors. Bowing his head he made humble entreaty: "It is against all statecraft: an envoy must not be killed. He may be punished in some other way, my master." All exclaimed to one another, "This is sound counsel, brother." Hearing this the ten-headed Rāvaṇa laughed and said, "All right, the monkey may be sent back mutilated.

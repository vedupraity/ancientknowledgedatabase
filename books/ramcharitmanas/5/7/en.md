### Dialogue between Sītā and Hanumān

### Sortas

#### kapi kari hṛdayaom bicāra dīnhi mudrikā ḍārī taba.
#### janu asōka aṃgāra dīnhi haraṣi uṭhi kara gahēu [5-11-12]

Then, taking thought within himself, Hanumān (the monkey chief) dropped down the signet ring, as though the Aśoka tree had thrown a spark (in response to Her prayer). She sprang up with joy and took it in Her hand.

Now She saw the charming ring with the name of Śrī Rāma most beautifully engraved on it. Recognizing the ring She looked at it with wonder and was agitated at heart with a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow. " Who can conquer the invincible Lord of the Raghus and such a (divine) ring cannot be prepared through Māyā ( a conjuring trick)." As Sītā thus indulged in fancies of various kinds, Hanumān spoke in honeyed accents and began to recount Śrī Rāmacandra's praises. The moment they reached Sītā's ears Her grief took flight. She listened with all Her soul and ears while Hanumān narrated the whole story from the very beginning. "Wherefore does she who has told this tale, which is like nectar to my ears, not reveal herself?*" Thereupon Hanumān drew near Her, while Sītā sat with her back turned towards him, full of amazement. "I am Śrī Rāma's messenger, mother Jānakī: I solemnly swear by the all-merciful Lord Himself. This ring has been brought by me, O mother; Śrī Rāma gave it to me as a token for you." "Tell me what brought about this fellowship between a man and a monkey." Then Hanumān explained the circumstances in which a union was brought about between men and monkeys.

- ***** Obviously the orchard in which Sītā had been confined was open to the fair sex alone. Naturally, therefore, when She heard an unseen voice utter Śrī Rāma's praises, She concluded that it must be some female.

As She heard the monkey's affectionate words Her soul trusted him and She recognized him to be a servant of the all-merciful Lord in thought, word and deed.

Perceiving him to be a devotee of Śrī Hari She developed an intense affection for him. Her eyes filled with tears and a thrill ran through Her body. "To me who was being drowned in the ocean of desolation, dear Hanumān, you have come as a veritable bark. Now tell me, I adjure you, the welfare of all-blissful Śrī Rāma (the Slayer of Khara) and His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa). Wherefore has the tender-hearted and compassionate Lord of the Raghus become so hard-hearted? Does the Chief of the Raghus ever remember me-He who is by natural disposition a source of delight to His servants ? Will my eyes, dear Hanumān, be ever gladdened by the sight of His swarthy and delicate limbs?" Words failed Her and Her eyes swam with tears. "Ah, my lord ! You have entirely forgotten me." Seeing Sītā sore distressed due to Her separation from Her lord, Hanumān addressed Her in soft and polite accents: "The Lord and His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) are both doing well, mother, except for the fact that the all-merciful is sorrowful because of Your sorrow. Do not feel vexed at heart, mother; Śrī Rāma loves You twice as much as You love Him.

#### raghupati kara saṃdēsu aba sunu jananī dhari dhīra.
#### asa kahi kapi gada gada bhayau bharē bilōcana nīra [5-14]

Mother, compose Yourself now and hear the message of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus)." Even as he uttered these words, the monkey's voice was choked with emotion and his eyes filled with tears.

Śrī Rāma said: Ever since I have been separated from you, Sītā, everything to me has become its very reverse. The fresh and tender leaves on the trees look like tongues of fire; nights appear as dreadful as the night of final dissolution and the moon scorches like the sun. Beds of lotuses are like so many spears planted on the ground, while rain-clouds pour boiling oil as it were. Those that were friendly before have now become tormenting; the cool, soft and fragrant breezes are now like the breath of a serpent. One's agony is assuaged to some extent even by speaking of it; but to whom shall I speak about it? For there is no one who will understand. The reality about the chord of love that binds you and me, dear, is known to my soul alone; and my soul ever abides with you. Know this to be the essence of my love." Videha's Daughter was so absorbed in love the moment She heard the Lord's message, that She lost all consciousness of Her body. Said the monkey, "Mother, collect Yourself, and fix Your thoughts on Śrī Rāma, the delight of His servants. Reflect on the glory of the Lord of the Raghus and shake off all faint-heartedness upon my word."

"The hosts of demons are like so many moths, while the shafts of the Lord of the Raghus are like flames. Have courage in Your heart, mother, and take the demons as consumed."

Had the Hero of Raghu's line any news about You, the Lord of the Raghus would not have tarried. The moment Śrī Rāma's arrows make their appearance like the sun, the demon host would be scattered like the shadows of night. Mother, I would take You to Him this very moment; but, I swear by Rāma, I have no such orders from the Lord. Therefore, wait patiently for some days more, mother, till the Hero of Raghu's line arrives with the troops of monkeys. Slaughtering the demons, He will take You away; while Nārada and the other sages will glorify Him in all the three spheres of creation." "But, my son, all the monkeys must be pygmies like you, whereas the demons are mighty and great warriors. I have grave misgivings in my heart on this score." On hearing this the monkey revealed His natural form, colossal as a mountain of gold, terrible in battle, possessing great might and full of valour. Sītā now took comfort in Her heart and the son of the wind-god thereupon resumed his diminutive appearance.

"Listen, mother: monkeys possess no great strength or intelligence either; but, through the Lord's might, the most tiny snake might swallow Garuḍa (the king of birds and the mount of Bhagavān Viṣṇu)."

Sītā felt gratified at heart even as She heard the monkey's words full of devotion and revealing Śrī Rāma's majesty, glory and strength. Recognizing him as the beloved of Śrī Rāma She gave him Her blessing: "May you become a repository of strength and virtue, dear child. May you ever remain immune from old age and death and prove to be a storehouse of good qualities, my son; and may the Lord of the Raghus shower His abundant grace on you." The moment the words "May the Lord be gracious to you" reached his ears Hanumān was utterly overwhelmed with emotion. Again and again the monkey bowed his head at Her feet and with joined palms addressed Her thus: "I have now accomplished all that I had to accomplish, my mother; for your blessing, everyone knows, is unfailing. Listen, mother: I am feeling frightfully hungry at the sight of these trees laden with delicious fruits." "I tell you, my son, this grove is guarded by most valiant and mighty demons." "Mother, I am not at all afraid of them, only if I have your hearty approval."

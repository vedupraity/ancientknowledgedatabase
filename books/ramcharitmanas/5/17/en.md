### Deliberation over the question of crossing the sea; appearance of Śuka, a spy of Rāvaṇa, and his return with Lakṣmaṇa's letter

### Dohas

#### prabhu tumhāra kulagura jaladhi kahihi upāya bicāri.
#### binu prayāsa sāgara tarihi sakala bhālu kapi dhāri [5-50]

My lord, the deity presiding over the ocean is an ancestor of Yours; hence he will think over the question and suggest some means (of crossing the ocean).* The whole host of bears and monkeys will thus be able to cross the ocean without much ado."

- ***** It is stated in the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki and other scriptures that the bed of the ocean was dug by King Sagara, hence it is known by the name of 'Sāgara.' King Sagara was an ancestor of Śrī Rāma and thus the deity presiding over the ocean is also spoken of by Vibhīṣaṇa as a forefather of the Lord.

"Friend, you have suggested an excellent plan; let us try it and see if Providence helps it." This counsel, however, did not find favour with Lakṣmaṇa, who was greatly pained to hear Śrī Rāma's words. "No reliance can be placed on the freaks of fortune. Fill your mind with indignation and dry up the ocean. Fate is a crutch for the mind of cowards alone; it is the indolent who proclaim their faith in fate." Hearing this the Hero of Raghu's line laughed and said, "We shall do accordingly; pray, ease your mind." Reassuring His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) with these words the Lord of the Raghus went to the seashore. First of all He bowed His head and greeted the ocean and then, spreading some Kuśa grass on the shore, took His seat thereon. As soon as Vibhīṣaṇa proceeded towards the Lord, Rāvaṇa sent spies after him

Assuming the false appearance of monkeys they witnessed all the doings of Śrī Rāma and praised in their heart the Lord's virtues and His fondness for those who come to Him for protection.

They openly commenced applauding Śrī Rāma's amiability and in the intensity of their emotion forgot their disguise. The monkeys now recognized them as the enemy's spies; they bound them all and brought them in the presence of Sugrīva (the lord of the monkeys). Said Sugrīva, "Listen, all you monkeys: mutilate the demons and dismiss them." Hearing Sugrīva's command the monkeys ran and paraded them in bonds all through the camp. The monkeys, then started belabouring them right and left; the demons piteously cried for help, yet the monkeys would not let them alone. "Whosoever robs us of our nose and ears, we adjure him by Śrī Rāma not to do so." When Lakṣmaṇa heard this, he called them all near him; and moved to pity he laughed and immediately had them released. "Give this note into Rāvaṇa's hands and tell him: read, destroyer of your race, what Lakṣmaṇa says."

Bowing their head at Lakṣmaṇa's feet the spies immediately departed, recounting the virtues of Śrī Rāma. With Śrī Rāma's praises on their lips they entered Laṅkā and bowed their head at Rāvaṇa's feet. The ten-headed monster laughed and asked them the news: "Report me, Śuka, your own welfare and then tell me the news about Vibhīṣaṇa whom death has approached very near. The fool left Laṅkā where he was ruling; the wretch will now be crushed as a weevil with barley-grains. Tell me next all about the host of bears and monkeys, that has been driven over here by a cruel destiny. It is the poor soft-hearted sea that has stood as a protector of their lives. Lastly tell me the news about the ascetics (Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) whose heart is obsessed with unceasing terror of me.

I adore the Lord of the universe bearing the name of Rāma, the Chief of Raghu's line and the crest-jewel of kings, the mine of compassion, the dispeller of all sins, appearing in human form through His Māyā (deluding potency), the greatest of all gods, knowable through Vedānta (the Upanisads), constantly worshipped by Brahmā (the Creator), Śambhu (Lord Śiva) and Śeṣa (the serpent-god), the bestower of supreme peace in the form of final beatitude, placid, eternal, beyond the ordinary means of cognition, sinless and all-pervading. (1) There is no other craving in my heart, O Lord of the Raghus: I speak the truth and You are the Spirit indwelling the hearts of all. Grant me intense devotion to Your feet, O crest-jewel of Raghus, and free my mind from faults like concupiscence etc. (2) I bow to the son of the wind-god, the beloved devotee of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), the chief of the monkeys, the repository of all virtues, the foremost among the wise, a fire to consume the forest of the demon race, possessing a body shining as a mountain of gold and a home of immeasurable strength.

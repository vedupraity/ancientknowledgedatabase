#### Dialogue between Sītā and Trijaṭā

#### Dohas

##### jahaom tahaom gaīṃ sakala taba sītā kara mana sōca.
##### māsa divasa bītēṃ mōhi mārihi nisicara pōca [5-11]

Then they all dispersed in various directions and Sītā anxiously thought within Herself: " At the end of a long month this vile monster will slay me."*

- ***** As appears from what follows, it is not death that Sītā dreads, but the long interval of a month which has to elapse before Her threatened death.

#### Chaupais

##### trijaṭā sana bōlī kara jōrī. mātu bipati saṃgini taiṃ mōrī
##### tajauṃ dēha karu bēgi upāī. dusahu birahu aba nahiṃ sahi jāī [5-11-1]
##### āni kāṭha racu citā banāī. mātu anala puni dēhi lagāī
##### satya karahi mama prīti sayānī. sunai kō śravana sūla sama bānī [5-11-2]
##### sunata bacana pada gahi samujhāēsi. prabhu pratāpa bala sujasu sunāēsi
##### nisi na anala mila sunu sukumārī. asa kahi sō nija bhavana sidhārī [5-11-3]
##### kaha sītā bidhi bhā pratikūlā. milahi na pāvaka miṭihi na sūlā
##### dēkhiata pragaṭa gagana aṃgārā. avani na āvata ēkau tārā [5-11-4]
##### pāvakamaya sasi stravata na āgī. mānahuom mōhi jāni hatabhāgī
##### sunahi binaya mama biṭapa asōkā. satya nāma karu haru mama sōkā [5-11-5]
##### nūtana kisalaya anala samānā. dēhi agini jani karahi nidānā
##### dēkhi parama birahākula sītā. sō chana kapihi kalapa sama bītā [5-11-6]

With joined palms She said to Trijaṭā, "Mother, you are my only companion in adversity. Therefore, quickly devise some means whereby I may be enabled to cast off this body; for this desolation, which is so hard to bear, can no longer be endured. Bring some wood and put up a pyre; and then, my mother, set fire to it. Thus prove the genuineness of my love for the Lord, O wise lady. Who will stand Rāvaṇa's words,that pierce the ear like a shaft?" On hearing these words she clasped Sītā's feet and comforted Her by recounting the majesty, might and glory of Her lord. "Listen, O tender lady: no fire can be had at night." So saying she left for her residence. Sītā said (to Herself) "Heaven itself has turned hostile to me; there is no fire to be had and I cannot be cured of my agony otherwise. Sparks of fire are visibly seen in the heavens; but not a single star drops to the earth. The moon, though all fire, refuses to rain sparks, as if conscious of my wretchedness. Hear my prayer, O Aśoka tree: take away my sorrow and answer to your name*. Your fresh and tender leaves bear the colour of flames; therefore, supply me with fire and do not aggravate my agony beyond limits." The moment seemed like an age† to Hanumān as he beheld Sītā extremely distressed due to Her separation from Her lord.

- ***** The word 'Aśoka' literally means that which ends sorrow.
- **†** Literally speaking, the word 'Kalpa' denotes the span of life of the universe, which has been calculated to cover 4,32,00,000 years.

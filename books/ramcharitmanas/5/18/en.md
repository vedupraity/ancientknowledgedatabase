Did you meet them or did they beat their retreat on hearing my fair renown? Why should you not speak of the enemy's prowess and strength; your wits seem utterly dazed."

My lord, just as you have so kindly put these questions to me, so do you believe what I say and be not angry. No sooner had your younger brother (Vibhīṣaṇa) met Śrī Rāma then the latter applied the sacred mark of sovereignty on his forehead. When the monkeys heard that we were Rāvaṇa's (Your majesty's) spies, they bound us and persecuted us in many ways. They were about to cut off our ears and nose; but when we adjured them by Rāma not to do so, they let us go. You have enquired, my lord, about Śrī Rāma's army; but a thousand million tongues would fail to describe it. It is a host of bears and monkeys of diverse hue and gruesome visage, huge and terrible. He who burnt your capital and killed your son (Akṣa) is the weakest of all the monkeys. The army includes innumerable champions with as many names, fierce and unyielding monsters of vast bulk and possessing the strength of numberless elephants."

Dvivida, Mainda, Nīla, Nala, Aṅgada, Gada, Vikaṭāsya, Dadhimukha, Kesarī, Niśaṭha, Śaṭha and the powerful Jāmbavān are some of them."

Each of these monkeys is as mighty as Sugrīva (the king) and there are tens of millions like them; who can dare count them? By the grace of Śrī Rāma they are unequalled in strength and reckon the three spheres of creation as of no more account than a blade of grass. I have heard it said, Rāvaṇa, that the commanders of the various monkey-troops alone number eighteen thousand billions. In the whole host, my lord, there is not a single monkey who would not conquer you in battle. They are all wringing their hands in excess of passion; but the Lord of the Raghus does not order them (to march)." 'We shall suck the ocean dry with all its fish and serpents or fill it up with huge mountains. Nay, we shall crush the ten-headed Rāvaṇa and reduce him to dust.' Such were the words that all the monkeys uttered. Fearless by nature, they roared and bullied as if they would devour Laṅkā.

"All the monkeys and bears are born warriors and, besides, they have Lord Śrī Rāma over their head. Rāvaṇa, they can conquer in battle even millions of Yamas (death personified)."

A hundred thousand Śeṣas would fail to describe the greatness of Śrī Rāma's valour, strength and intelligence. With a single shaft He could dry up a hundred seas; yet, being a master of propriety, He consulted your brother (Vibhīṣaṇa) and in accordance with his suggestion He is asking passage of the ocean with a heart full of compassion." The ten-headed monster laughed to hear these words. "It was because of such wits that he (Rāma) took monkeys for his allies. That is why, confirming the advice of my brother, who is a born coward, he is persistent in demanding of the ocean (like a pet child) something which is impossible. Fool, why do you bestow false praise on the enemy, whose might and wisdom I have fathomed. Triumph and glory in this world are inaccessible to him who has a cowardly counsellor like Vibhīṣaṇa." The spy waxed angry to hear the words of the wicked monarch and taking it to be an opportune moment he took out the letter (from Lakṣmaṇa). "Śrī Rāma's younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) gave me this note; have it read, my lord, and soothe your heart." Rāvaṇa laughed when he took the letter in his left hand; and summoning his minister, the fool asked him to read it out.

Beguiling your mind with flattering words, O fool, do not bring your race to utter ruin. By courting enmity with Śrī Rāma you will not be spared even though you seek the protection of Viṣṇu, Brahmā or Śiva. Therefore, abandoning pride, like your younger brother, either seek the lotus feet of the Lord as a bee or be consumed with your family like a moth into the fire of Śrī Rāma's shafts, O wretch.

Rāvaṇa was dismayed at heart as he listened to the above message but wore a feigned smile on his face and spoke aloud for all to hear: "The younger hermit's grand eloquence is just like attempt of a man lying on the ground to clutch with hands the vault of heaven." Said Śuka, "My lord, giving up haughtiness take every word of it as true. Abandon passion and give ear to my advice: my lord, avoid a clash with Śrī Rāma. The Hero of Raghu's line is exceedingly mild of disposition, even though He is the lord of the entire universe. The Lord will shower His grace on you the moment you meet Him, and will not take to heart even a single offence of yours. Pray, restore Janaka's Daughter to Śrī Rāma; at least concede this request of mine." When Śuka asked him to surrender Videha's Daughter, the wretch kicked him. Śuka, however, bowed his head at Rāvaṇa's feet and proceeded to the place where the all-merciful Lord of the Raghus was. Making obeisance to the Lord he told Him all about himself and by Rāma's grace recovered his original state. He was an enlightened sage; it was by Agastya's curse, Pārvatī, that he had been transformed into a demon. Adoring Śrī Rāma's feet again and again the sage returned to his hermitage.

#### Encounter between Lakṣmaṇa and Rāvaṇa

#### Dohas

##### nija dala bikala dēkhi kaṭi kasi niṣaṃga dhanu hātha.
##### lachimana calē kruddha hōi nāi rāma pada mātha..82.. [6-82]

Seeing the distress of his troops Lakṣmaṇa fastened the quiver to his waist; and taking the bow in his hand he bowed his head at Śrī Rāma's feet and sallied forth, full of rage.

##### rē khala kā mārasi kapi bhālū. mōhi bilōku tōra maiṃ kālū..
##### khōjata rahēu tōhi sutaghātī. āju nipāti juḍaāvau chātī.. [6-82-1]
##### asa kahi chāḍaēsi bāna pracaṃḍā. lachimana kiē sakala sata khaṃḍā..
##### kōṭinha āyudha rāvana ḍārē. tila pravāna kari kāṭi nivārē.. [6-82-2]
##### puni nija bānanha kīnha prahārā. syaṃdanu bhaṃji sārathī mārā..
##### sata sata sara mārē dasa bhālā. giri sṛṃganha janu prabisahiṃ byālā.. [6-82-3]
##### puni sata sara mārā ura māhīṃ. parēu dharani tala sudhi kachu nāhīṃ..
##### uṭhā prabala puni muruchā jāgī. chāḍaisi brahma dīnhi jō sāomgī.. [6-82-4]

"Pooh! You are making the monkeys and bears your target, O vile wretch; look at me, I am your death." "It is you whom I have been looking for, you slayer of my son. Today I will soothe my heart by killing you." So saying he discharged a flight of fierce arrows; but Lakṣmaṇa shivered them into a hundred pieces each. Nay, Rāvaṇa hurled upon him myriads of other missiles, but Lakṣmaṇa foiled them all by reducing them to particles as small as sesamum seeds. Again, Lakṣmaṇa assailed him with his own shafts, smashing his chariot and killing the charioteer. Nay, each of his ten heads he transfixed with a hundred arrows, which seemed like serpents boring their way into the peaks of a mountain. With a hundred arrows more he struck him in the breast: he fell senseless to the ground. On regaining his consciousness the mighty demon rose again and hurled a lance that had been bestowed on him by Brahmā (the Creator).

#### Chhands

##### sō brahma datta pracaṃḍa sakti anaṃta ura lāgī sahī.
##### paryō bīra bikala uṭhāva dasamukha atula bala mahimā rahī..
##### brahmāṃḍa bhavana birāja jākēṃ ēka sira jimi raja kanī.
##### tēhi caha uṭhāvana mūḍha rāvana jāna nahiṃ tribhuana dhanī..

That fierce lance, the gift of Brahma, struck Lord Ananta (Lakṣmaṇa) right in the breast and the hero dropped to the ground full of agony. The ten-headed monster tried to lift the Prince and carry him off, but the glory of the demon's matchless strength proved ineffective. How foolish it was on the part of Rāvaṇa to have sought to lift him on one of whose (thousand) heads rest all the spheres of the universe like a mere grain of sand. He little knew that he was no other than the Lord of the three spheres.

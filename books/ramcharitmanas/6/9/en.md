"Ponder in your mind, my beloved lord, and abandon perversity; your conflict with the Lord of the Raghus is quite out of place. Śrī Rāma's younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) had traced a thin line;* that too you could not cross. Such is your valour! My beloved, do you expect to conquer Him in battle, whose messenger performed such feats? Leaping across the ocean in mere sport, that lion among monkeys fearlessly entered your Laṅkā, killed your guards and laid waste your garden. Nay, he killed Prince Akṣa under your very nose, and, setting fire to the whole capital, reduced it to ashes. Where did your pride of power remain lurking at that time? Indulge no more in idle boasts, my spouse, and lay my words a little to heart. Do not imagine that the Lord of the Raghus is a mere earthly king, my husband; but know him to be the Ruler of the animate and inanimate creation, unequalled in strength. The might of His arrows is known to Mārīca; but you did not heed his words, taking him to be a mean fellow. In Janaka's court were assembled numberless kings; you too were present there with your incomparable and enormous strength. There Śrī Rāma broke Śiva bow and won the hand of Janaka's Daughter; why did you not conquer Him in battle then? The son of Indra (the lord of celestials) tasted of His strength when He caught hold of him and spared his life after destroying one of his eyes. You also witnessed Śūrpaṇakhā's condition, yet you did not feel much abashed in your heart.

- ***** It is mentioned in other works that, while leaving Sītā all alone to join Śrī Rāma, who had been out chasing the gold deer, Lakṣmaṇa traced with an end of his bow a line round, Her cottage at Pañcavaṭī with a curse that any demon whatsoever who dared to cross the line would be instantly reduced to ashes. Availing himself of the opportunity Rāvaṇa made his appearance there in the guise of a mendicant and begged alms of Sītā; and the latter offered to give him alms while keeping within the line. Rāvaṇa, however, refused to accept the alms from within a barrier and carried off Sītā as soon as She overstepped the boundary.

"He who had the ocean bridged as a mere pastime and has encamped with His host on Mount Suvela, the same merciful Lord, the glory of the solar race, sent to you in your own interest an ambassador who, like a lion in the midst of a herd of elephants trampled on your might in open court. Nay, He has for His servants most formidable warriors like Aṅgada and Hanumān, who are so dauntless in battle; and still, my beloved lord, you speak of Him again and again as a mortal ! In vain do you carry on your head the burden of pride, attachment and arrogance. Ah, my lord, you have turned hostile to Śrī Rāma and, overtaken as you are by death, the light of wisdom does not dawn on your mind. Death does not smite anyone with uplifted rod; he simply robs the victim of his piety, strength, reason and judgment. He alone whom death has approached very near falls a prey to delusion like you."

Hearing the words of his consort (Mandodarī), which were piercing like a shaft, he rose and left for his council-chamber as soon as the day broke. Forgetting all his fears he went and occupied his throne bloated with excess of pride. At this end Śrī Rāma summoned Aṅgada, who came and bowed his head at the Lord's lotus feet. The gracious Rāma (the slayer of Khara) most politely seated him by His side and smilingly said, "O son of Vāli, I have great curiosity in my mind; therefore, I ask you a question. Tell me the truth, dear child. Rāvaṇa is the head of the demon race; he is celebrated throughout the world for his incomparable might. It is rather strange that you tossed no less than four of his crowns to me; tell me, my son, by what device you were able to lay your hands on them?" "Listen, O omniscient lord, the delighter of the suppliant : they were no crowns but the four virtues (resources) of a king, viz., Sama (conciliation), Dana (gift), Daṇḍa (physical force or coercion) and Bheda (division), which abide in the heart of a king- so declare the Vedas, my lord. They are the beautiful pedestals of statesmanship: remembering this, they themselves came to my lord (who is a true repository of all statesmanlike virtues)."

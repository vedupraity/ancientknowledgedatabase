### Vibhīṣaṇa rains down clothes and ornaments from the air and the monkeys and bears pick them up and adorn their person with them

#### kṛpāsiṃdhu sōi kapinha sana karata anēka binōda..117ka.. [6-117(A)]
#### umā jōga japa dāna tapa nānā makha brata nēma.

That Ocean of compassion, whom sages are unable to catch even in meditation and whom the Vedas describe only in negative terms such as "Not that, not that," amused himself with the monkeys in diverse ways. Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) practice of Yoga (concentration of mind), Japa (muttering of prayers), charity and penance, performance of sacrifices, fasting and other religious observances fail to evoke Śrī Rāma's compassion to the same degree as unalloyed devotion does.

Having thus secured raiment and jewels, the bears and monkeys adorned their person with the same and appeared before the Lord of the Raghus. The Lord of Kosala laughed again and again to see all the monkeys, a motley host indeed. The Lord of the Raghus showered His grace on all by casting a look at them, and spoke to them in endearing terms: "It was through your might that I succeeded first in killing Rāvaṇa and then in crowning Vibhīṣaṇa. Now return all of you to your several homes; keep your thought fixed on Me and fear none." The monkeys were all overcome with affection to hear these words and reverently replied with joined palms: O Lord, whatever You say well becomes of You. But we get mystified on hearing Your words. You are the Sovereign of all the three spheres, O Lord of the Raghus; knowing our humble state You took us under Your protection. But we are overwhelmed with shame to hear such words from the lips of our Master (Yourself). Can a swarm of mosquitoes ever help Garuḍav (the king of the birds)?" The bears and monkeys were overpowered with emotion when they saw what was in the mind of the Lord, (viz., His reluctance to take them to Ayodhyā); they had no inclination to return home.

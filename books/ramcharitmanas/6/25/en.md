Then the ten-headed monster in his fury hurled forth his terrible lance, which flew straight towards Vibhīṣaṇa like the rod of Death.

When the Lord saw the most fearful lance coming, He thought to Himself, "It is My sacred vow to put an end to the distress of the suppliant!" Instantly Śrī Rāma put Vibhīṣaṇa behind Him and exposed Himself to the full force of the spear. When the lance struck Him, the Lord fainted for a while. Although it was a mere sport on the part of the Lord, the gods were filled with dismay. When Vibhīṣaṇa saw that the Lord had been grievously hurt, he seized his club and rushed forward full of rage. "You wretched vile and perverse fool ! You have antagonized gods, human beings, sages and Nāgas alike. You devoutly offered your heads to Lord Śiva and have got millions for one in return. It is for this reason, O wretch, that you have been spared till this time; your death, however, seems to be impending now. Fool, you seek happiness through enmity with Śrī Rāma?" So saying, Vibhīṣaṇa struck his brother right on the chest with his club.

### Chhands

#### ura mājha gadā prahāra ghōra kaṭhōra lāgata mahi par yō.
#### dasa badana sōnita stravata puni saṃbhāri dhāyō risa bhar yō..
#### dvau bhirē atibala mallajuddha biruddha ēku ēkahi hanai.
#### raghubīra bala darpita bibhīṣanu ghāli nahiṃ tā kahu ganai..

At the terrible impact of the mighty club on his chest Rāvaṇa fell to the ground, all his ten mouths spouting blood. But he picked himself up again and darted forward full of fury. The two mighty champions closed with each other in a wrestling contest, each mauling the other. Vibhīṣaṇa, however, who was inspired with the strength of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line), deemed his adversary as of no account.

### Dohas

#### umā bibhīṣanu rāvanahi sanmukha citava ki kāu.
#### sō aba bhirata kāla jyōṃ śrīraghubīra prabhāu..94.. [6-94]

Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) Vibhīṣaṇa would never have dared of himself to look Rāvaṇa in the face. Armed with the might of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line), however, he now closed with his brother like Death himself.

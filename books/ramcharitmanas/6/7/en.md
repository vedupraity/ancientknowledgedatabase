#### Mandodarī makes remonstrance with Rāvaṇa again and dwells upon Śrī Rāma's glory

#### Dohas

##### bisvarupa raghubaṃsa mani karahu bacana bisvāsu.
##### lōka kalpanā bēda kara aṃga aṃga prati jāsu..14.. [6-14]

"Believe my word that Śrī Rāma (the Jewel of Raghu's race) Himself is manifested in the form of this universe and that the Vedas conceive of every limb of His as a distinct sphere."

"The subterranean regions (Pātāla) are His feet and the abode of Brahma His head; while the other (intermediate) spheres are located in His other limbs. Terrible Death is the mere contraction of His eyebrows, the sun is His eye and the mass of clouds His locks. The twin-born gods Aśvinīkumāras (the celestial physicians) are His nostrils and the alternating days and nights constitute the repeated twinkling of His eyelids; while the ten quarters of the heavens are His ears: so declare the Vedas. The winds are His breath and the Vedas, His own speech; greed is His lower lip and Yama (the god who sits in judgment on the dead), His dreadful teeth; Māyā (cosmic illusion) is His laughter and the regents* of the ten quarters, His arms; fire is His mouth and Varuṇa (the god presiding over the waters), His tongue; while the creation, preservation and destruction of the universe are His gestures. The eighteen principal species of the vegetable kingdom constitute the line of hair on His belly, the mountains are His bones and the rivers represent the network of His veins. The ocean is His belly and the inferno, His organs of urination and excretion. In short, the universe is a manifestation of the Lord and it is no use going into further details.

- ***** The ten quarters alongwith their regents are named below:
- | Name of the quarter | Regent | 
 | -- | -- | 
 | East | Indra (the lord of paradise) | 
 | South-East | Agni (the god of fire) | 
 | South | Yama (the god who recompenses our deeds after death) | 
 | South-West | Nirṛti (the lord of the Rākṣasas of a benevolent type) | 
 | West | Varuṇa (the god presiding over the waters) | 
 | North-West | Vāyu (the wind-god) | 
 | North | Kubera (the god of riches) | 
 | North-East | Īśāna (Lord Śiva) | 
 | The Upper Region | Brahmā (the Creator) | 
 | The Lower Region | Ananta (the serpent-god) |

"Lord Śiva is His ego, Brahma His reason, the moon His mind and the great Viṣṇu is His faculty of understanding. It is the same Lord Śrī Rāma, manifested in the form of this animate and inanimate creation, who has assumed a human semblance. Pondering thus, hear me, O lord of my life: cease hostility with the Lord and cultivate devotion to the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line) so that my good-luck* may not desert me."

- ***** Good-luck in the eyes of a Hindu lady consists in the longevity of her husband and widowhood is considered as the greatest curse.

Rāvaṇa laughed when he heard the words of his wife. "Oh, how mighty is the power of infatuation! They rightly observe in regard to the character of a woman that the following eight evils ever abide in her heart: recklessness, mendacity, fickleness, deceit, timidity, indiscretion, impurity and callousness. You have described the enemy's cosmic form and thus told me a most alarming story. But all that (whatever is comprised in that cosmic form), my beloved, is naturally under my control; it is by your grace that this has become clear to me now. I have come to know your ingenuity, my dear; for in this way you have told my greatness. Your words, O fawn-eyed lady, are profound: they afford delight when understood and dispel all fear even when heard." Mandodarī was now convinced at heart that her husband's impending death had deluded him.

While Rāvaṇa was laughing and joking in diverse ways as mentioned above, the day broke and the king of Laṅkā, who was intrepid by nature and further blinded by pride, entered the court. The reed neither blossoms nor bears fruit even though the clouds rain nectar on it. Similarly the light of wisdom would never dawn on a fool even though he may have a teacher like Virañci (Brahma).

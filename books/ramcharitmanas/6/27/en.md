#### Fierce fighting; Rāvaṇa's swoon

#### Chhands

##### gahi bhūmi pār yō lāta mār yō bālisuta prabhu pahiṃ gayō.
##### saṃbhāri uṭhi dasakaṃṭha ghōra kaṭhōra rava garjata bhayō..
##### kari dāpa cāpa caḍhaāi dasa saṃdhāni sara bahu baraṣaī.
##### kiē sakala bhaṭa ghāyala bhayākula dēkhi nija bala haraṣaī..

Having seized Rāvaṇa and thrown him to the ground, Vāli's son (Aṅgada) gave him a kick and then rejoined his lord. The ten-headed monster, on recovering himself, rose again and roared terribly in a shrill voice. Proudly drawing the string of all his ten bows he fitted a dart to each and rained a flight of arrows, wounding all the warriors in the enemy's ranks to their utter dismay and confusion; and rejoiced to see his own might.

##### taba raghupati rāvana kē sīsa bhujā sara cāpa.
##### kāṭē bahuta baḍhaē puni jimi tīratha kara pāpa. 97.. [6-97]

Thereupon the Lord of the Raghus tore off Rāvaṇa's heads and arms, alongwith the arrows and bows; more than once. But each time they all multiplied like sins committed in a holy place.

The bears and monkeys grew furious when they saw the repeated renewal of Rāvaṇa's heads and arms. "This fool would not die even though his arms and heads are cut off!" So saying, the bear and monkey warriors darted towards him in great fury. Vāli's son (Aṅgada), the son of the wind-god, Nala, Nīla, Sugrīva (the king of the monkeys) and Dwivida, all mighty heroes, hurled trees and rocks on him. Rāvaṇa, however, caught them and threw the same back upon the monkeys. Some of the monkeys tore the enemy's body with their claws, while others would kick him and run away. Then Nala and Nīla climbed up his heads and set to tearing his foreheads with their claws. When he saw blood coming, he felt much troubled at heart and moved up his arms to catch hold of the monkeys. But they were not to be caught and leapt about from one hand to another like a pair of bees hovering over a bed of lotuses. At last with a furious bound he clutched them both; but before he could dash them to the ground, they twisted his arms and ran away. Again in his fury he took ten bows in his hands and with his arrows struck and wounded the monkeys. Having rendered Hanumān and other monkey chiefs senseless he rejoiced to see the approach of night. Seeing all the monkey heroes in a swoon the valiant Jāmbavān rushed forward with a host of bears carrying rocks and trees, which they hurled upon him, challenging him again and again. This enraged the mighty Rāvaṇa, who seized a number of the warriors by the foot and began dashing them to the ground. Jāmbavān (the king of the bears) flew into a rage when he saw the havoc wrought on his host, and gave Rāvaṇa a kick on the breast.

##### ura lāta ghāta pracaṃḍa lāgata bikala ratha tē mahi parā.
##### gahi bhālu bīsahu kara manahu kamalanhi basē nisi madhukarā..
##### muruchita bilōki bahōri pada hati bhālupati prabhu pahiṃ gayau.
##### nisi jāni syaṃdana ghāli tēhi taba sūta jatanu karata bhayō..

The violent impact of the foot on his breast made Rāvaṇa senseless and he fell from his chariot to the ground, grasping a bear in each of his twenty hands, like bees reposing by night in the folds of the lotus. Seeing him unconscious, the king of the bears struck him with his foot once more and rejoined the Lord. Perceiving that it was night, the charioteer lifted him on to his chariot and then tried to bring him back to his senses.

#### Dohas

##### muruchā bigata bhālu kapi saba āē prabhu pāsa.
##### nisicara sakala rāvanahi ghēri rahē ati trāsa..98.. [6-98]

On recovering from their swoon the bears and monkeys all arrived in the presence of the Lord, while all the demons stood round Rāvaṇa in great consternation.

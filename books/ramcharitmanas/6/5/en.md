At this end the Hero of Raghu's line encamped with his vast army on Mount Suvela. Observing a very lofty, supremely lovely, even and remarkably shining peak, Lakṣmaṇa carefully spread on it whith his own hands beautiful young leaves and blossoms of trees, which he covered with a charming and soft deerskin; it was on this seat that the gracious Lord rested Himself. The Lord placed His head in the lap of Sugrīva (the lord of the monkeys) with the bow and quiver to His left and right. He was passing both His lotus hands on an arrow, while the would-be king of Laṅkā (Vibhīṣaṇa) whispered some secret in His ears. The blessed Aṅgada and Hanumān kneaded His lotus-feet in diverse ways; while behind the Lord sat Lakṣmaṇa in the pose of a warrior, with the quiver fastened at his waist and the bow and arrow ready in his hands.

Thus rested Śrī Rāma, the embodiment of benignity, beauty and goodness. Blessed are those men who remain ever immersed in the thought of the Lord as depicted here. Looking towards the east the Lord saw the moon risen above the horizon and said to them all, "Just look at the moon and see how undaunted like the king of beasts (lion) he appears."

"Dwelling in the eastern quarter, which may be compared to a mountain-cave, this lion of a moon, an embodiment of supreme grandeur, glory and strength, struts through the forest of the sky having rent asunder the crown of a mad elephant in the form of the darkness. The stars appear like so many pearls strewn all over the sky, which serve to adorn the lovely dame of night." "Now tell me, brethren," continued the Lord, "What you think, each of you, of the dark spot in the moon." Said Sugrīva, "Listen, O Lord of the Raghus: it is only the shadow of the earth that is seen in the moon." "The demon Rāhu struck the moon," said another; "and the spot is nothing but a scar left on the latter's bosom." A third suggested: "When Brahmā (the Creator) fashioned the face of Rati (consort of the god of love), he took out the essence of the moon (thus leaving a hole in the orb thereof). The hole is still visible in the heart of the moon and through it can be seen the shade of the blue." The Lord said, "Poison is the moon's most beloved brother; that is why he has lodged it in his heart and, diffusing his envenomed rays, torments parted lovers."

Said Hanumān, "Listen, my lord: the moon is Your own beloved servant and it is Your image enshrined in his heart that appears as a dark patch." The all-wise Śrī Rāma smiled to hear the words of Hanumān (the son of the wind-god). Then, looking towards the south, the All-merciful Lord spoke thus:-

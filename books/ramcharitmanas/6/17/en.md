#### suni dasakaṃdhara bacana taba kuṃbhakarana bilakhāna.
#### jagadaṃbā hari āni aba saṭha cāhata kalyāna..62.. [6-62]

On hearing the words of his ten-headed brother, Kumbhakarṇa felt very sorry. "Having carried off the Mother of the universe, O fool, you still expect good out of it!"

"You have not acted well, O demon king. And now why have you come and woke me up? Yet, abandoning pride, worship Śrī Rāma and you will be blessed. Can the Lord of the Raghus, O ten-headed Rāvaṇa, be a man, who has couriers like Hanumān? Alas, brother, you acted unwisely in that you did not break this news to me earlier. You have courted war with the Divinity who has for His servants gods like Śiva and Virañci (the Creator). I would have confided to you the secret which the sage Nārada had once imparted to me; but the time has passed. Squeeze me, brother, in close embrace now, so that I may go and bless my eyes with the sight of the Lord who has a swarthy complexion and lotus-like eyes and who relieves the threefold agony of His devotees."

#### rāma rūpa guna sumirata magana bhayau chana ēka.
#### rāvana māgēu kōṭi ghaṭa mada aru mahiṣa anēka..63.. [6-63]

As he thought of Śrī Rāma's beauty and virtues he forgot himself for a moment. In the meantime Rāvaṇa requisitioned (for his consumption) myriads of jars full of wine and a whole herd of buffaloes.

#### mahiṣa khāi kari madirā pānā. garjā bajrāghāta samānā..
#### kuṃbhakarana durmada rana raṃgā. calā durga taji sēna na saṃgā.. [6-63-1]

#### tēhiṃ galāni raghupati pahiṃ āyau. dēkhi dīna prabhu kē mana bhāyau.. [6-63-3]
#### sunu suta bhayau kālabasa rāvana. sō ki māna aba parama sikhāvana..

#### baṃdhu baṃsa taiṃ kīnha ujāgara. bhajēhu rāma sōbhā sukha sāgara.. [6-63-5]

Having feasted on the buffaloes and drunk off the wine, Kumbhakarṇa roared like a crash of lightning. Heavily drunk and full of passion for war, he sallied forth from the fort without any troops. When Vibhīṣaṇa saw him, he came forward and falling at his feet told him his name. Kumbhakarṇa in his turn lifted his younger brother and clasped him to his bosom; he was delighted at heart to know that his brother was a devotee of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). "Dear brother, Rāvaṇa spurned me with his foot when I gave him a most salutary advice and told him my view. Disgusted with such treatment I came away to Śrī Rāma, and the Lord's heart was drawn towards me when he perceived my distress." "Listen, my son; Rāvaṇa is in the clutches of death and would not listen even to the best advice at this stage. Thrice blessed are you, Vibhīṣaṇa; you have proved to be the ornament of the demon race. Brother, you have brought glory to our line by adoring Śrī Rāma, that ocean of beauty and felicity.

### Dohas

#### bacana karma mana kapaṭa taji bhajēhu rāma ranadhīra.
#### jāhu na nija para sūjha mōhi bhayau kālabasa bīra. 64.. [6-64]

In thought, word and deed you should guilelessly worship Śrī Rāma, who is staunch in battle. Now leave me; for, doomed as I am to death, brother, I can no longer distinguish between friend and foe."

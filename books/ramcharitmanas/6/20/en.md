When Meghanāda recovered from his swoon, he felt much ashamed to find his father before him. He speedily betook himself to a convenient mountain cave and resolved to perform a sacrifice which would render him invincible. At this end Vibhīṣaṇa approached the Lord and told Him his considered view. "Listen, my lord of incomparable might and generosity: the wicked Meghanāda, who is a past master in creating illusions and the scourge of heaven, is performing an unholy sacrifice. If, my lord, the sacrifice is allowed to be completed, he will not then be speedily conquered." The Lord of the Raghus was highly gratified to hear this and summoned Aṅgada and many other monkeys. "Go with Lakṣmaṇa, brethren all, and wreck the sacrifice. And it is for you, Lakṣmaṇa, to kill him in battle. I am much distressed to find the gods in terror. You must finish him by force of your wit might or one way or other, mark me, brother, the demon must be put an end to. And Jāmbavān, Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa, you three must keep by his side with your regiment." When the Hero of Raghu's line had finished His command, Lakṣmaṇa, who was staunch in battle, girt the quiver by his side and strung his bow; and cherishing the Lord's glory in his heart, he spoke in a voice deep as thunder, "If I return today without slaying him (Meghanāda), let me no longer be called a servant of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). Nay, even if a hundred Śivas come to his help, I shall nonetheless kill him in the name of Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line)."

Bowing his head at the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), Lakṣmaṇa (who was none else than Lord Ananta or Śeṣa) set out at once, accompanied by champions like Aṅgada, Nīla, Mayanda, Nala and Hanumān.

Arriving there, the monkeys found him squatting and offering oblations of blood and live buffaloes to the sacrificial fire. The monkeys wrecked the whole sacrifice; yet, when the demon refused to stir, they proceeded to applaud him (ironically). Even then he did not quit his place; the monkeys thereupon went and caught him by the hair and, striking him with the foot one after the other, ran away. He rushed forth, trident in hand, while the monkeys fled before him and came where Śrī Rāma's younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) stood at the head of his army. Driven by the wildest fury he came and shouted with a terrible roar again and again. The son of the wind-god and Aṅgada darted forward in great indignation: but he struck them on the breast with his trident and felled them to the ground. He then hurled his fierce trident at the Lord (Lakṣmaṇa): but Ananta intercepted it with his arrow and broke it in two. Meanwhile the son of the wind-god and Prince Aṅgada had risen again and struck him furiously; but he received no injury. When the heroes turned round thinking that the enemy could not be killed in spite of the best efforts, he rushed forth with a terrible yell. When Lakṣmaṇa saw him coming furiously like Death himself, he let fly fierce arrows. The wretch, however, vanished out of sight the moment he saw arrow terrible as thunderbolt darting towards him. He fought in various guises, now revealing himself and now disappearing. The monkeys were filled with dismay when they saw that the enemy could not be conquered. Lakṣmaṇa (the lord of serpents) thereupon flew into a towering rage. He made a firm resolve in his mind to dispose of the demon; for he thought, "I have played with this wretch long enough." Recalling the might of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of Kosala), he defiantly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot it with such steady aim that it struck Meghanāda full in the breast and the demon abandoned all false appearances at the moment of death.

He gave up his ghost with the words "Where is Rāma's younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa)?" "Where is Rāma?" On his lips. "Blessed indeed is your mother!" exclaimed Aṅgada and Hanumān.

Hanumān lifted him without any exertion and after placing him at the main gate of Laṅkā returned. Hearing of his death, the gods as well as the Gandharvas all appeared in the heavens in their aerial cars. Raining down flowers, they beat their drums and sang the spotless glory of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). "Glory to Lord Ananta! Glory to the support of the whole universe! You, O lord, have delivered the gods." Having thus hymned his praises, the gods as well as the Siddhas went their way, while Lakṣmaṇa arrived in the presence of the All-merciful. The moment the ten-headed monster heard the news of his son's death, he dropped senseless to the ground. Mandodarī made grievous lamentation, beating her breast and crying in many ways. The citizens were all smitten with grief; everyone abused Rāvaṇa.

The ten-headed monster then consoled all the womenfolk in various ways. "Perceive and realize in your heart", he said, "That the entire universe is perishable.

Rāvaṇa taught them sound wisdom; though vile himself, his counsel was so pious and wholesome! Indeed there are hosts of people clever in instructing others; but those who practise good morals themselves are few and far between. When the night was over and the day broke, the bears and monkeys invested all the four gates. The ten-headed monster summoned his champions and said, "He whose heart quails before the enemy in battle had better withdraw even now; for if he turns his back on the field of battle, he will have to suffer for it. Relying on the strength of my own arm have I prosecuted the war and shall give befitting reply to the enemy who has invaded us." So saying, he got ready his chariot, swift as the wind, and all the musical instruments of war sounded. The heroes, who were all matchless in strength, rushed forth like a storm of soot. Numberless ill-omens occurred at that time; but, extremely proud of his might of arm, he heeded them not.

In his overweening pride he took no heed of the omens, whether good or bad. Weapons dropped from his hands and warriors fell down from their cars, while horses and elephants ran shrieking out of the line. Frightful jackals, vultures and donkeys gave a shrill cry while dogs whined in large numbers. And owls, like messengers of death, uttered most alarming notes.

"Vibhīṣaṇa, see how clouds are gathering fast and the lightning flashes in the southern quarter. A lowering cloud is gently rumbling and I fear lest a severe hail-storm may ensue." Vibhīṣaṇa replied, "Listen, my gracious lord: there is neither lightning nor a gathered mass of cloud. On the top of Laṅkā there stands a hall where Rāvaṇa is witnessing a music and dancing contest. It is the large royal umbrella spread over his head which presents the appearance of a thick dark mass of cloud; the ornaments in Queen Mandodarī's ears, my lord, flash like lightning; while the incomparable music of cymbals and tabors is the sweet rumbling that You hear, O King of celestials." The Lord smiled to perceive Rāvaṇa's arrogance; He strung His bow and fitted an arrow to the string.

With a single shaft the Lord then struck Rāvaṇa's umbrella and crowns as well as Mandodarī's ear-drops, which fell to the ground before the very eyes of all; but none could know the mystery. Having performed this startling feat Śrī Rāma's shaft came back and dropped into His quiver again. And everybody in Rāvaṇa's assembly was alarmed to see this great interruption in his revelry.

There was no earthquake nor any strong gust of wind. Nor did they see any weapon or missile. All however, pondered within themselves that it was a most alarming ill-omen. When the ten-headed monster saw that the assembly had taken fright, he laughed and made the following ingenious remarks: "How can the mere dropping down of crowns be an ill-omen to him in whose case even the falling of heads proved a lasting boon? Therefore, return each to your own home and retire." Accordingly all bowed their head and returned home. But anxiety lodged in Mandodarī's hearts ever since her earrings dropped to the ground. With eyes full of tears and joining both her palms she said, "O lord of my life, listen to my prayer. My beloved, cease hostility with Śrī Rāma and have no more of obstinacy in your heart taking Him to be a mere mortal."

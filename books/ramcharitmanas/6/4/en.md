Then, realizing his own nervousness, he laughed and left for his palace forgetting his fear. When Mandodarī (Rāvaṇa's consort) heard that the Lord had arrived and bridged the ocean in mere sport, she took her spouse by the hand, led him to her own palace and spoke to him in most sweet accents. Bowing her head at his feet, she spread the end of her garment as a token of supplication and said, "Listen to my words without getting angry, my beloved: one should enter into hostilities with him alone whom one may be able to conquer by wit or physical force. The disparity between you and the Lord of the Raghus, however, is certainly analogous to that obtaining between a fire-fly and the sun. He who disposed of the most powerful Madhu and Kaiṭabha and finished the most valiant sons of Diti (Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa), nay, who bound Bali and despatched King Sahasrabāhu (so-called because he was possessed of a thousand arms)-it is He who has descended on earth in order to relieve it of its burden. My lord, you should not oppose Him who is the Master of Time, fate and the soul."

Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), my lord, is compassionate to the humble (He will surely forgive you). Even a tiger (the most ferocious of all beasts) will not devour a man if he goes submissively before him. You have already accomplished all that you had to do: you have conquered not only gods and demons but the whole animate and inanimate creation. Holy men, my lord, have declared this maxim that a monarch should retire to the forest in the fourth stage of his life. There, my spouse, you should adore Him who is the creator, preserver and destroyer (of the universe). Renouncing all worldly ties, my lord, worship the selfsame Hero of Raghu's line, who is fond of the suppliant. The same Lord of the Raghus, the King of Kosala, whom the greatest of sages strive hard to realize and for whom monarchs relinquish their throne and shed every attachment- it is He who has arrived here to shower His grace on you. If, my beloved, you accept my advice, your fair and exceedingly holy renown shall spread through all the three spheres."

Thereupon Rāvaṇa lifted Māyā's daughter (Mandodarī) and the wretch began to harp on his own glory. "Listen, darling; you are haunted by idle fears. What warrior in this world is my equal? I have conquered by the might of my arm not only Varuṇa (the god presiding over the waters), Kubera (the god of riches), the wind-god, Yama (the god of punishment), and all the other regents of the quarters but Death himself. Gods, demons and human beings are all under my control; what is the cause of your fear, then?" He thus reassured her in many ways and once more went and sat in his council-chamber. Mandodarī was now convinced at heart that it was her husband's impending death which had turned his head. Returning to his council-hall he asked his ministers: "How shall we proceed to fight the enemy?" "Listen, O lord of the demons," replied the ministers, "why do you ask this question again and again? What is there to be afraid of, which should engage our thought? Human beings, monkeys and bears are our food."

All your stupid ministers tell you only that which is pleasing to their master; but that way you cannot succeed; my lord. A stray monkey sprang across the ocean and came this side and all the people still extol his doings in their heart of hearts. What ! Did none of you have any appetite then? Why did you not seize and devour him while he was burning your city? Your ministers have given you, my lord, an advice which, though pleasant to hear, will hand you in trouble afterwards. He who has had the sea bridged in mere sport and has crossed over to the Suvela hill with all his army, tell me, is He an ordinary mortal whom you say you will devour? All these people are simply bragging. Dear father, listen to my words with great attention and do not account me a coward. There are multitudes of men in this world who are given to hearing and uttering pleasant words. Those men, however, who hear and utter words which are most salutary yet jarring to the ear are few and far between, my lord. Listen to my sound advice : first send an envoy to Śrī Rāma; and afterwards, when you have restored Janaka's Daughter, make friends with Him."

"If, my lord, you accept this advice of mine, your fair renown will spread throughout the world in either case." The ten-headed monster asked his son (Prahasta) in a fury, "Fool, who has taught you such wisdom? If you entertain doubt in your mind from even now, my son, you have proved yourself to be a prickly plant at the root of a bamboo (which brings about the destruction of the bamboo)." On hearing the harsh and most malignant remarks of his father Prahasta left for home uttering these bitter words: "Words of good counsel fall flat on you even as a medicine proves ineffectual for a man who is doomed to die." Finding that it was evening now the ten-headed monster turned towards his palace fondly gazing on his twenty arms. On the highest level of Laṅkā stood a most wonderful hall, where music and dancing contests used to be held. Rāvaṇa went and took his seat in that hall, while Kiṁnaras (celestial songsters) began to sing his praises. Expert celestial nymphs commenced their dance to the accompaniment of cymbals, tabors and lutes.

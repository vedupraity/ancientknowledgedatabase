##### aputrasya gṛhaṃ śūnyaṃ diśaḥ śūnyāstvabāndhavāḥ .
##### mūrkhasya hṛdayaṃ śūnyaṃ sarvaśūnyā daridratā ..

#### Translation

The house of a childless person is a void, all directions are void to one who has no relatives, the heart of a fool is also void, but to a poverty stricken man all is void.

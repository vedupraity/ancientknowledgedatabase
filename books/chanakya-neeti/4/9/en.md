##### kiṃ tayā kriyate dhenvā yā na dogdhrī na garbhiṇī .
##### ko'rthaḥ putreṇa jātena yo na vidvān bhaktimān ..

#### Translation

What good is a cow that neither gives milk nor conceives? Similarly, what is the value of the birth of a son if he becomes neither learned nor a pure devotee of the Lord?

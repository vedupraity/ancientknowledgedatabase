##### agnirdevo dvijātīnāṃ munīnāṃ hṛdi daivatam .
##### pratimā svalpabuddhīnāṃ sarvatra samadarśinaḥ ..

#### Translation

For the twice-born the fire (Agni) is a representative of God. The Supreme Lord resides in the heart of His devotees. Those of average intelligence (alpa-buddhi or kanista-adhikari) see God only in His srimurti, but those of broad vision see the Supreme Lord everywhere.

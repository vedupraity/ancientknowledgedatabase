##### anabhyāse viṣaṃ śāstramajīrṇe bhojanaṃ viṣam .
##### daridrasya viṣaṃ goṣṭhī vṛddhasya taruṇī viṣam ..

#### Translation

Scriptural lessons not put into practice are poison; a meal is poison to him who suffers from indigestion; a social gathering is poison to a poverty stricken person; and a young wife is poison to an aged man.

##### ayuktaṃ svāmino yuktaṃ yuktaṃ nīcasya dūṣaṇam .
##### amṛtaṃ rāhave mṛtyurviṣaṃ śaṃkarabhūṣaṇam ..

#### Translation

A bad action committed by a great man is not censured (as there is none that can reproach him), and a good action performed by a low-class man comes to be condemned (because none respects him). Just see: the drinking of nectar is excellent, but it became the cause of Rahu's demise; and the drinking of poison is harmful, but when Lord Shiva (who is exalted) drank it, it became an ornament to his neck.

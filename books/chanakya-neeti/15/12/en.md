##### paṭhanti caturo vedān dharmaśāstrāṇyanekaśaḥ .
##### ātmānaṃ naiva jānanti darvī pākarasaṃ yathā ..

#### Translation

One may know the four Vedas and the Dharma-Śāstras, yet if he has no realisation of his own spiritual self, he can be said to be like the ladle which stirs all kinds of foods but knows not the taste of any.

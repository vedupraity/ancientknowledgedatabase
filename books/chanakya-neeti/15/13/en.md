##### dhanyā dvijamayī naukā viparītā bhavārṇave .
##### tarantyadhogatāḥ sarve uparisthāḥ patantyadhaḥ ..

#### Translation

Those blessed souls are certainly elevated who, while crossing the ocean of life, take shelter of a genuine Brāhmaṇa, who is likened unto a boat. They are unlike passengers aboard an ordinary ship which runs the risk of sinking.

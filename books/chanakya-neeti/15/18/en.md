##### chinno'pi candanataruna jahāti gandhaṃ
##### vṛddho'pi vāraṇapatirna jahāti līlām .
##### yantrārpito madhuratāṃ na jahāti cekṣuḥ
##### kṣīṇo'pi na tyajati śīlaguṇān kulīnaḥ ..

#### Translation

Although sandalwood be cut, it does not forsake its natural quality of fragrance; so also the elephant does not give up sportiveness though he should grow old. The sugarcane does not cease to be sweet though squeezed in a mill; so the man of noble extraction does not lose his lofty qualities, no matter how pinched he is by poverty.

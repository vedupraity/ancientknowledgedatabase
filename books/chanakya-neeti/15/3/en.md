##### khalānāṃ kaṇṭakānāṃ ca dvividhaiva pratikriyā .
##### upānanmukhabhaṃgo vā dūrato vā visarjanam ..

#### Translation

There are two ways to get rid of thorns and wicked persons; using footwear in the first case and in the second shaming them so that they cannot raise their faces again thus keeping them at a distance.

##### tadbhojanaṃ yad dvijabhuktaśeṣaṃ tatsauhṛdaṃ yatkriyate parasmin .
##### sā prājñatā yā na karoti pāpaṃ dambhaṃ vinā yaḥ kriyate sa dharmaḥ ..

#### Translation

A true meal is that which consists of the remnants left after a Brāhmaṇa's meal. Love which is shown to others is true love, not that which is cherished for one's own self. to abstain from sin is true wisdom. That is an act of charity which is performed without ostentation.

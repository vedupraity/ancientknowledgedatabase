#### Translation

(Lord Viṣṇu asked His spouse Lakṣmī why She did not care to live in the house of a Brāhmaṇa, when She replied) ' O Lord a Rishi named Agastya drank up My father (the ocean) in anger; Bhṛgu Muni kicked You in the chest; Brāhmaṇas pride themselves on their learning having sought the favour of My competitor Sarasvatī; and lastly they pluck each day the lotus which is My abode, and therewith worship Lord Shiva. Therefore, O Lord, I fear to dwell with a Brāhmaṇa and that properly.

#### Translation

Though the sea, which is the reservoir of all jewels, is the father of the conch shell, and the Goddess of fortune Lakṣmī is conch's sister, still the conch must go from door to door for alms (in the hands of a beggar). It is true, therefore, that one gains nothing without having given in the past.

##### dānena pāṇirna tu kaṃkaṇena snānena śuddhirna tu candanena .
##### mānena tṛptirna tu bhojanena jñānena muktirna tu maṇḍanena ..

#### Translation

The hand is not so well adorned by ornaments as by charitable offerings; one does not become clean by smearing sandalwood paste upon the body as by taking a bath; one does not become so much satisfied by dinner as by having respect shown to him; and salvation is not attained by self-adornment as by cultivation of spiritual knowledge.

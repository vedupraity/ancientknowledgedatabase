##### sadyaḥ prajñāharā tuṇḍī sadyaḥ prajñākarī vacā .
##### sadyaḥ śaktiharā nārī sadyaḥ śaktikaraṃ payaḥ ..

#### Translation

The eating of tundi fruit deprives a man of his sense, while the vacha root administered revives his reasoning immediately. A woman at once robs a man of his vigour while milk at once restores it.

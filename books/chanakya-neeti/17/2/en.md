##### kṛte pratikṛtaṃ kuryād hiṃsane pratihiṃsanam .
##### tatra doṣo na patati duṣṭe duṣṭaṃ samācaret ..

#### Translation

We should repay the favours of others by acts of kindness; so also should we return evil for evil in which there is no sin, for it is necessary to pay a wicked man in his own coin.

##### adhaḥ paśyasi kiṃ vṛddhe patitaṃ tava kiṃ bhuvi .
##### re re mūrkha na jānāsi gataṃ tāruṇyamauktikam ..

#### Translation

Seeing a very old woman, who is bent down due to old age, a young man satirically asked - O lady, why are you gazing downward? Has something of yours fallen on the ground? (She replies) O fool, can you not understand the pearl of my youth has slipped away?

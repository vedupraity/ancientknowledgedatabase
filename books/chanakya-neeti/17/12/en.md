##### nāpitasya gṛhe kṣauraṃ pāṣāṇe gandhalepanam .
##### ātmarūpaṃ jale paśyan śakrasyāpi śriyaṃ haret ..

#### Translation

Going to the barber making hair, applying scented substances like sandalwood on a stone and seeing one's own form and reflection in water, these acts also destroy the beauty of Indra.

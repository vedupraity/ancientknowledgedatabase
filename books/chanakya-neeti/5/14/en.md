##### tṛṇaṃ brahmavidaḥ svargastṛṇaṃ śūrasya jīvitam .
##### jitā'śasya tṛṇaṃ nārī niḥspṛhasya tṛṇaṃ jagat ..

#### Translation

Heaven is but a straw to him who knows spiritual life (Krsna consciousness); so is life to a valiant man; a woman to him who has subdued his senses; and the universe to him who is without attachment for the world.

##### calā lakṣmīścalāḥ prāṇāścalaṃ jīvita-yauvanam .
##### calācale ca saṃsāre dharma eko hi niścalaḥ ..

#### Translation

The Goddess of wealth is unsteady (chanchala), and so is the life breath. The duration of life is uncertain, and the place of habitation is uncertain; but in all this inconsistent world religious merit alone is immovable.

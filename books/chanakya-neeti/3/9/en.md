##### kokilānāṃ svaro rūpaṃ strīṇāṃ rūpaṃ pativratam .
##### vidyā rūpaṃ kurūpāṇāṃ kṣamā rūpaṃ tapasvinām ..

#### Translation

The beauty of a cuckoo is in its notes, that of a woman in her unalloyed devotion to her husband, that of an ugly person in his scholarship, and that of an ascetic in his forgiveness.

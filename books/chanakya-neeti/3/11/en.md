##### udyoge nāsti dāridrayaṃ japato nāsti pātakam .
##### maune ca kalaho nāsti nāsti jāgarite bhayam ..

#### Translation

There is no poverty for the industrious. Sin does not attach itself to the person practicing japa (chanting of the holy names of the Lord). Those who are absorbed in maunam (silent contemplation of the Lord) have no quarrel with others. They are fearless who remain always alert.

##### atirūpeṇa vai sītā atigarveṇa rāvaṇaḥ .
##### atidānāt balirbaddho ati sarvatra varjayet ..

#### Translation

Devi Seeta was abducted by Ravana the Demon King, because of her being extremely beautiful, and  Ravana did this  being extremely proud of his power.   Due to his extremely charitable nature the Demon King Bali also had his downfall from his kingdom.  Therefore, we should always give up the habit of going to the extreme in any case or a situation.

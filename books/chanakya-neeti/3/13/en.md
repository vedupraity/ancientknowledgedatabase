##### ko hi bhāraḥ samarthānāṃ kiṃ dūraṃ vyavasāyinām .
##### ko videśaḥ savidyānāṃ kaḥ paraḥ priyavādinām ..

#### Translation

What is too heavy for the strong and what place is too distant for those who put forth effort? What country is foreign to a man of true learning? Who can be inimical to one who speaks pleasingly?

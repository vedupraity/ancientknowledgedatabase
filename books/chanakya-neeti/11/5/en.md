##### gṛhā'saktasya no vidyā no dayā māṃsabhojinaḥ .
##### dravyalubdhasya no satyaṃ straiṇasya na pavitratā ..

#### Translation

He who is engrossed in family life will never acquire knowledge; there can be no mercy in the eater of flesh; the greedy man will not be truthful; and purity will not be found in a woman and a hunter.

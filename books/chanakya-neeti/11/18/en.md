#### Translation

The meritorious should give away in charity all that they have in excess of their needs. By charity only Bali, Karṇa and King Vikramāditya survive even today. Just see the plight of the honeybees beating their legs in despair upon the earth. They are saying to themselves, 'Alas! We neither enjoyed our stored-up honey nor gave it in charity, and now someone has taken it from us in an instant.'

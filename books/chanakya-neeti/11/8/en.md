##### na vetti yo yasya guṇaprakarṣaṃ sa taṃ sadā nindati nā'tra citram .
##### yathā kirātī karikumbhajātā muktāḥ parityajya bibharti guñjāḥ ..

#### Translation

It is not strange if a man reviles (Degrades) a thing of which he has no knowledge, just as a wild hunter's wife throws away the pearl that is found in the head of an elephant, and picks up a Gunja (a type of seed which poor tribals wear as ornaments).

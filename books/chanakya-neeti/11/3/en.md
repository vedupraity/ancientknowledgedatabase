##### hastī sthūlatanuḥ sa cāṃkuśavaśaḥ kiṃ hastimātrokuśo
##### dīpa prajvalite praṇaśyati tamaḥ kiṃ dīpamātraṃ tamaḥ .
##### vajeṇāpi hatāḥ patanti girayaḥ kiṃ vajramātro girim
##### tejo yasya virājate sa balavān sthūleṣu kaḥ pratyayaḥ ..

#### Translation

The elephant has a huge body but is controlled by the goad: yet, is the goad as large as the elephant? A lighted candle vanishes darkness: is the candle as vast as the darkness. A mountain is broken even by a thunderbolt: is the thunderbolt therefore as big as the mountain? No, he whose power prevails is really mighty; what is there in bulk?

##### ārteṣu vipreṣu dayānvitaśca yat śraddhayā svalpamupaiti dānam .
##### anantapāraṃ samupaiti rājan yaddīyate tanna labhed dvijebhyaḥ ..

#### Translation

One who devotedly gives a little to a Brāhmaṇa who is in distress is recompensed abundantly. Hence, O King, what is given to a good Brāhmaṇa is got back not in an equal quantity, but in an infinitely higher degree.

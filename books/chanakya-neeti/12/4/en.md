#### Translation

O jackal, leave aside the body of that man at once, whose hands have never given in charity, whose ears did not listen to the scriptures like Vedas etc, whose eyes have not beheld a pure devotee of the Lord, whose feet have never traversed to holy places, whose belly is filled with things obtained by crooked practices, and whose head is held high in vanity. Do not eat it, O jackal, otherwise you will become polluted.

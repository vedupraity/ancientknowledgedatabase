#### Translation

What fault of spring that the bamboo shoot has no leaves? What fault of the sun if the owl cannot see during the daytime? Is it the fault of the clouds if no raindrops fall into the mouth of the Cātaka bird? Who can erase what Lord Brahmā has inscribed upon our foreheads at the time of birth?

#### Translation

'O Rāghava, the love of virtue, pleasing speech, and an ardent desire for performing acts of charity, guileless dealings with friends, humility in the guru's presence, deep tranquillity of mind, pure conduct, discernment of virtues, realised knowledge of the sastras, beauty of form and devotion to God are all found in you.' (The great sage Vaśiṣṭha Muni, the spiritual preceptor of the dynasty of the sun, said this to Lord Rāmacandra at the time of His proposed coronation).

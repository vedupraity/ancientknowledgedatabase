##### satsaṃgādbhavati hi sādhutā khalānāṃ sādhūnāṃ na hi khalasaṃgamātkhalatvam .
##### āmodaṃ kusuma-bhavaṃ mṛdeva dhatte mṛdgandhaṃ na hi kusumāni dhārayanti ..

#### Translation

A wicked man may develop saintly qualities in the company of a devotee, but a devotee does not become impious in the company of a wicked person. The earth is scented by a flower that falls upon it, but the flower does not contact the odour of the earth.

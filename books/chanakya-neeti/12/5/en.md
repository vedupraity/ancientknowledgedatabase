#### Translation

'Shame upon those who have no devotion to the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of mother Yaśodā; who have no attachment for the describing the glories of Śrīmatī Rādhārānī; whose ears are not eager to listen to the stories of the Lord's līlā.' Such is the exclamation of the Mṛdaṃga (a percussion instrument) sound of dhik-tam dhik-tam dhigatam at kīrtana.

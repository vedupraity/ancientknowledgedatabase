##### mātṛvat paradārāṃśca paradravyāṇi loṣṭhavat .
##### ātmavat sarvabhūtāni yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati ..

#### Translation

He who regards another's wife as his mother, the wealth that does not belong to him as a lump of mud, and the pleasure and pain of all other living beings as his own -- truly sees things in the right perspective, and he is a true Pandit.

##### sādhūnāṃ darśanaṃ puṇyaṃ tīrthabhūtā hi sādhavaḥ .
##### kālena phalate tīrthaṃ sadyaḥ sādhusamāgamaḥ ..

#### Translation

One indeed becomes blessed by having darshan of a devotee; for the devotee has the ability to purify immediately, whereas the sacred tirtha gives purity only after prolonged contact.

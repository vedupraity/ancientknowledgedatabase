#### Translation

A stranger asked a Brāhmaṇa, 'Tell me, who is great in this city?' The Brāhmaṇa replied, 'The cluster of palmyra trees is great.' Then the traveller asked, 'Who is the most charitable person?' The Brāhmaṇa answered, 'The washerman who takes the clothes in the morning and gives them back in the evening is the most charitable.' He then asked, 'Who is the ablest man?' The Brāhmaṇa answered, 'Everyone is expert in robbing others of their wives and wealth.' The man then asked the Brāhmaṇa, 'How do you manage to live in such a city?' The Brāhmaṇa replied, 'As a worm survives while even in a filthy place so do I survive here!'

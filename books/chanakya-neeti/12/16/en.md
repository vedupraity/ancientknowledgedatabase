#### Translation

The desire tree (Kalpavṛkṣa) is wood; the golden Mount Sumeru is motionless; the wish-fulfilling gem Ciṃtāmaṇi is just a stone; the sun is scorching; the moon is prone to wane; the boundless ocean is saline; the God of lust lost his body (due to Shiva's wrath); charitable King Bali, was born into a clan of demons; and Kāmadhenu (the cow of heaven) is a mere beast. O Lord Rāma! I cannot compare you to any one of these (taking their merits into account).

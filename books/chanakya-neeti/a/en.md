### Chanakya Neeti

---

Just as definite principles are discovered in science and they are confirmed by repeated experiments with uniform conclusions, similarly ethics also has a definite tradition. Its conclusions are also the same in every situation. That is why Acharya Chanakya has called these ethics as science. They also talk about being 'omniscient' through this knowledge. To be omniscient here means to acquire the ability to analyze past, present and future.

##### annahīno dahed rāṣṭra mantrahīnaśca ṛtvijaḥ .
##### yajamānaṃ dānahīno nāsti yajñasamo ripuḥ ..

#### Translation

There is no enemy like a yajna (sacrifice) which consumes the kingdom when not attended by feeding on a large scale; consumes the priest when the chanting is not done properly; and consumes the yajaman (the responsible person) when the gifts are not made.

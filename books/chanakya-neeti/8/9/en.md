##### vṛddhakāle mṛtā bhāryā baṃdhuhaste gataṃ dhanam .
##### bhojanaṃ ca parādhīnaṃ tistraḥ puṃsāṃ viḍambanā ..

#### Translation

Death of a wife in old age, wealth or property gone in the hands of brothers and relatives and being dependent on others for food, these three things are as painful as death for a man.

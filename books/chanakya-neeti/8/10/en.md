##### nāgnihotraṃ vinā vedā na ca dānaṃ vinā kriyā .
##### na bhāvena vinā siddhistasmādbhāvo hi kāraṇam ..

#### Translation

Chanting of the Vedas without making ritualistic sacrifices to the Supreme Lord through the medium of Agni, and sacrifices not followed by bountiful gifts are futile. Perfection can be achieved only through devotion (to the Supreme Lord) for devotion is the basis of all success.

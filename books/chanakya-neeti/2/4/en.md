##### te putrā ye piturbhaktāḥ sa pitā yastu poṣakaḥ .
##### tanmitraṃ yasya viśvāsaḥ sā bhāryā yatra nirvṛtiḥ ..

#### Translation

They alone are sons who are devoted to their father. He is a father who supports his sons. He is a friend in whom we can confide, and she only is a wife in whose company the husband feels contented and peaceful.

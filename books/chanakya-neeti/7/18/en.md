##### gamyate yadi mṛgendra-mandiraṃ labhyate karikapolamauktikam .
##### jambukā'layagate ca prāpyate vatsa-puccha-khara-carma khaṇḍanam ..

#### Translation

By going to the den of a lion pearls from the head of an elephant may be obtained; but by visiting the hole of a jackal nothing but the tail of a calf or a bit of the hide of an ass may found.

##### puṣpe gandhaṃ tile tailaṃ kāṣṭhe'gniṃ payasi ghṛtam .
##### ikṣau guḍaṃ tathā dehe paśyā'tmānaṃ vivekataḥ ..

#### Translation

As you seek fragrance in a flower, oil in the sesamum seed, fire in wood, ghee in milk, and jaggery (guda) in sugarcane; so seek the spirit that is in the body by means of discrimination.

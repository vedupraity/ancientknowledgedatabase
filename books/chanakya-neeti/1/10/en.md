##### lokayātrā bhayaṃ lajjā dākṣiṇyaṃ tyāgaśīlatā .
##### pañca yatra na vidyante na kuryāt tatra saṃsthitim ..

#### Translation

Wise men should never go into a country where there are no means of earning one's livelihood, where the people have no dread of anybody, have no sense of shame, no intelligence, or a charitable disposition.

##### varayet kulajāṃ prājño virūpāmapi kanyakām .
##### rūpavatīṃ na nīcasya vivāhaḥ sadṛśe kule ..

#### Translation

A wise man should marry a girl born in a respectable family even if she is deformed. He should not marry one of a low-class (uncultured) family, through beauty. Marriage in a family of equal status is preferable.

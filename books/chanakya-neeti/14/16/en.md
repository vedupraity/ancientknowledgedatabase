##### eka evaṃ padārthastu tridhā bhavati vīkṣitaḥ .
##### kuṇapaḥ kāminī māṃsaṃ yogibhiḥ kāmibhiḥ śvabhiḥ ..

#### Translation

One single object appears in three different ways: to the man who practices austerity it appears as a corpse, to the sensual it appears as a woman, and to the dogs as a lump of flesh.

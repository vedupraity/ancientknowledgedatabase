##### atyāsannā vināśāya dūrasthā na phalapradāḥ .
##### sevitavyaṃ madhyabhāgena rājā vahanirguruḥ striyaḥ ..

#### Translation

It is ruinous to be familiar with the king, fire, the religious preceptor, and a woman. To be altogether indifferent of them is to be deprived of the opportunity to benefit ourselves, hence our association with them must be from a safe distance.

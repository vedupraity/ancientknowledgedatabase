##### dharmā'khyāne śmaśāne ca rogiṇāṃ yā matirbhavet .
##### sā sarvadaiva tiṣṭheccet ko na mucyeta bandhanāt ..

#### Translation

If men always retain the state of mind they experience when hearing religious instruction, when present at a crematorium ground, and when in sickness -- then who could not attain liberation?

#### Translation

No messenger can travel about in the sky and no tidings come from there. The voice of its inhabitants as never heard, nor can any contact be established with them. Therefore the Brāhmaṇa who predicts the eclipse of the sun and moon which occur in the sky must be considered as a vidwan (man of great learning).

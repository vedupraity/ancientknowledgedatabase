##### muktimicchasi cettāta viṣayān viṣavat tyaja .
##### kṣamā'rjavaṃ dayā śaucaṃ satyaṃ pīyūṣavad bhaja ..

#### Translation

My dear child, if you desire to be free from the cycle of birth and death, then abandon the objects of sense gratification as poison. Drink instead the nectar of forbearance, upright conduct, mercy, cleanliness and truth.

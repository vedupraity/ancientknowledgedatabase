##### varaṃ na rājyaṃ na kurājarājyaṃ varaṃ na mitraṃ na kumitramitram .
##### varaṃ na śiṣyo na kuśiṣyaśiṣyo varaṃ na dārā na kudāradārāḥ ..

#### Translation

It is better to be without a kingdom than to rule over a petty one; better to be without a friend than to befriend a rascal; better to be without a disciple than to have a stupid one; and better to be without a wife than to have a bad one.

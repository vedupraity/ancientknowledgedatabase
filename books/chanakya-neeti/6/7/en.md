##### na paśyati ca janmāndhaḥ kāmāndho naiva paśyati .
##### na paśyati madonmatto hārthī doṣān na paśyati ..

#### Translation

Those born blind cannot see; similarly blind are those in the grip of lust. Proud men have no perception of evil; and those bent on acquiring riches see no sin in their actions.

##### svayaṃ karma karotyātmā svayaṃ tatphalamaśnute .
##### svayaṃ bhramati saṃsāre svayaṃ tasmādvimucyate ..

#### Translation

The spirit soul goes through his own course of karma and he himself suffers the good and bad results thereby accrued. By his own actions he entangles himself in samsara, and by his own efforts he extricates himself.

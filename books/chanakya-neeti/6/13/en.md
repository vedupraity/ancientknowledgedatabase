##### kurājarājyena kutaḥ prajāsukhaṃ kumitramitreṇa kuto'sti nirvṛtiḥ .
##### kudāradāraiśca kuto gṛhe ratiḥ kuśiṣyamadhyāpayataḥ kuto yaśaḥ ..

#### Translation

How can people be made happy in a petty kingdom? What peace can we expect from a rascal friend? What happiness can we have at home in the company of a bad wife? How can renown be gained by instructing an unworthy disciple?

#### Translation

It certainly is nature of the Gods, men of good character, and parents to be easily pleased by good behaviour. Near and distant relatives are pleased when they are hospitably received with bathing, food, and drink; and Pandits are pleased with an opportunity for giving spiritual discourse.

##### muhūrtamapi jīvecca naraḥ śuklena karmaṇā .
##### na kalpamapi kaṣṭena lokadvayavirodhinā ..

#### Translation

A man may live but for a moment, but that moment should be spent in doing auspicious deeds. It is useless living even for a Kalpa (thousand years) and bringing only distress upon the two worlds (this world and the next).

##### anavasthitakāryasya na jane na vane sukham .
##### jane dahati saṃsargo vane saṃgavivarjanam ..

#### Translation

He whose actions are disorganised has no happiness either in the midst of men or in a jungle -- in the midst of men his heart burns by social contacts, and his helplessness burns him in the forest.

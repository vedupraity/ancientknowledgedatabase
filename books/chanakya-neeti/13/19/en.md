##### yugānte pracalate meru: kalpānte sapta sāgarāḥ .
##### sādhavaḥ pratipannārthān na calanti kadācana ..

#### Translation

At the end of the yuga, Mount Meru may be shaken; at the end of the kalpa, the waters of the seven oceans may be disturbed; but a sadhu will never swerve from the spiritual path.

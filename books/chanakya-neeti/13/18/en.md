##### ekākṣarapradātāraṃ yo guruṃ nābhivandati .
##### śvānayoniśataṃ bhuktvā cāṇḍāleṣvabhijāyate ..

#### Translation

Even the man who has taught the spiritual significance of just one letter ought to be worshiped. He who does not give reverence to such a guru is born as a dog a hundred times, and at last takes birth as a Cāṇḍāla (dog-eater).

##### bandhāya viṣayā'saktaṃ muktyai nirviṣayaṃ manaḥ .
##### mana evaṃ manuṣyāṇāṃ kāraṇaṃ bandhamokṣayoḥ ..

#### Translation

Excessive attachment to sense pleasures leads to bondage, and detachment from sense pleasures leads to liberation; therefore it is the mind alone that is responsible for bondage or liberation.

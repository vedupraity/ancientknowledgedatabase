##### buddhiryasya balaṃ tasya nirbuddhestu kuto balam .
##### vane siṃho madonmattaḥ śaśakena nipātitaḥ ..

#### Translation

He who possesses intelligence is strong; how can the man that is unintelligent be powerful? The elephant of the forest having lost his senses by intoxication was tricked into a lake by a small rabbit. (this verse refers to a famous story from the niti-sastra called pancatantra compiled by the pandit Vishnusharma 2500 years ago).

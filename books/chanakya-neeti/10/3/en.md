##### sukhārthī vā tyajedvidyāṃ vidyārthī vā tyajet sukham .
##### sukhārthinaḥ kuto vidyā vidyārthinaḥ kuto sukham ..

#### Translation

He who desires sense gratification must give up all thoughts of acquiring knowledge; and he who seeks knowledge must not hope for sense gratification. How can he who seeks sense gratification acquire knowledge, and he who possesses knowledge enjoy mundane sense pleasure?

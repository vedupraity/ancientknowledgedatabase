##### vipro vṛkṣastasya mūlaṃ ca saṃdhyā vedāḥ śākhā dharmakarmāṇi patram .
##### tasmānmūlaṃ yatnato rakṣaṇīyaṃ chinne mūle naiva śākhā na patram ..

#### Translation

The Brāhmaṇa is like tree; his prayers are the roots, his chanting of the Vedas are the branches, and his religious act are the leaves. Consequently effort should be made to preserve his roots for if the roots are destroyed there can be no branches or leaves.

##### guṇāḥ sarvatra pūjyante na mahatyo'pi sampadaḥ .
##### pūrṇendu kiṃ tathā vandyo niṣkalaṃko yathā kṛśaḥ ..

#### Translation

Human beings are respected everywhere because of their qualities. Even if a virtuous person has a wealth, he is not respected. The way the moon of Dooj (crescent moon) is worshiped or considered auspicious, the full moon does not get the same respect as the moon of Dooj, which has very little light, but is free from stains.

##### para-proktaguṇo yastu nirguṇo'pi guṇī bhavet .
##### indro'pi laghutāṃ yāti svayaṃ prakhyāpitairguṇaiḥ ..

#### Translation

The man who is praised by others as great is regarded as worthy though he may be really void of all merit. But the man who sings his own praises lowers himself in the estimation of others though he should be Indra (the possessor of all excellences).

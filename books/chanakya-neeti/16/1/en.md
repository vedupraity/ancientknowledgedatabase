#### Translation

The life of a person is complete scrap and waste who do not pray to the supreme personality of Godhead to attain salvation, not perform a good deed to earn an entry into heaven, and one who has not even dreamt of enjoying a woman. Such a person is compared to an axe on his mother’s youthful beauty, by taking birth from her womb and did not achieve anything in the world.

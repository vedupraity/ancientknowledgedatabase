##### jalpanti sārdhamanyena paśyantyanyaṃ savibhramāḥ .
##### hṛdaye cintayantyanyaṃ na strīṇāmekato ratiḥ ..

#### Translation

The heart of a prostitute (lustful woman) is not united; it is divided. While she is talking with one man, she looks lustfully at another and thinks fondly of a third in her heart.

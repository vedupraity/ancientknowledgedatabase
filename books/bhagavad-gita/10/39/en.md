#### mayā bhūtaṁ carācaram

### Synonyms

**yat** — whatever; **ca** — also; **api** — may be; **sarva**-**bhūtānām** — of all creations; **bījam** — seed; **tat** — that; **aham** — I am; **arjuna** — O Arjuna; **na** — not; **tat** — that; **asti** — there is; **vinā** — without; **yat** — which; **syāt** — exists; **mayā** — Me; **bhūtam** — created being; **cara**-**acaram** — moving and nonmoving.

### Translation

Furthermore, O Arjuna, I am the generating seed of all existences. There is no being – moving or nonmoving – that can exist without Me.

### Purport

Everything has a cause, and that cause or seed of manifestation is Kṛṣṇa. Without Kṛṣṇa’s energy, nothing can exist; therefore He is called omnipotent. Without His potency, neither the movable nor the immovable can exist. Whatever existence is not founded on the energy of Kṛṣṇa is called māyā, “that which is not.”

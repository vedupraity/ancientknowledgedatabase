### Shri Vishnu Mantra (Śrī Viṣṇu Mantra)

---

##### śāntākāraṃ bhujagaśayanaṃ padmanābhaṃ sureśaṃ
##### viśvādhāraṃ gaganasadṛśaṃ meghavarṇaṃ śubhāṅgam .

(I Meditate on Lord Vishnu) Who has a Serene Appearance, Who is Lying on the Bed of Śeṣanāga (serpent), from Whose Navel is springing up a Lotus (which is the source of all Creations through Brahmadeva), and Who is the Lord of the Devas (Gods), Who is the foundation of the whole Universe, and is Boundless and Infinite like the Sky pervading everywhere, with a Form Bluish in Colour like the Cloud, which is radiating Auspiciousness,

##### lakṣmīkāntaṃ kamalanayanaṃ yogibhirdhyānagamyaṃ
##### vande viṣṇuṃ bhavabhayaharaṃ sarvalokaikanātham ..

Who is the Beloved (consort) of Devi Lakṣmī with Eyes Beautiful like Lotus petals, Who is Attainable by the Yogis only through Meditation, I Worship that All-Pervading Vishnu Who Removes the Fear of Worldly Existence, Who is the One Lord of All the Worlds.

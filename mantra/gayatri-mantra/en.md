The Gāyatrī Mantra, also known as the Sāvitri Mantra, is a highly revered mantra from the Rig Veda (Mandala 3.62.10), dedicated to the Vedic deity Savitr. Gāyatrī is the name of the Goddess of the Vedic Mantra in which the verse is composed. Its recitation is traditionally preceded by oṃ and the formula bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, known as the Mahāvyāhṛti, or "great (mystical) utterance".

Gayatri, Savitri and Saraswati are latent in everybody. Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ and Svaḥ in the Gayatri mantra refer to the body (materialization), the life-force (vibration), and the soul (radiation). Bhūr means the earth, which is the combination of materials. This denotes the human body, which is also a combination of materials. Bhuvaḥ refers to the life-force, which makes the body vibrate. Svaḥ refers to Prajnāna-shakti, which sustains the life-force. This Prajnāna-shakti is known as constant integrated awareness. This is also termed as radiation. All three, namely, materialization (physical body), vibration (mental body), and radiation (Atma) are present in man.

Hosts of demons are roaming about in the forest; I, therefore, suspect Sītā is not at the hermitage.\" Lakṣmaṇa clasped Śrī Rāma's lotus feet and replied with joined palms, \"Lord, it is no fault of mine.\" Accompanied by His younger brother, the Lord went back to His hermitage on the bank of the Godāvarī. When He saw the hermitage bereft of Janaka's Daughter, He felt as perturbed and afflicted as any common man. \" Alas! Sītā, Janaka's daughter, the very mine of virtues, of such flawless beauty, character, austerity and devotion!\" Lakṣmaṇa consoled Him in many ways. He questioned all the creepers and trees (that stood on the way ) as He went along (in search of Her): \" O birds and deer, O string of bees, have you seen the fawn-eyed Sītā? The wagtail, the parrot, the pigeon, the deer, the fish, the swarms of bees, the clever cuckoo, the jasmine buds, the pomegranate, the lightning, the lotus, the autumnal moon, the gliding serpent, the noose of Varuna (the god of water), the bow of Cupid, the swan, the elephant and the lion now hear themselves praised. The Bilva fruit and the gold banana rejoice and do not feel the least misgiving or bashfulness* Listen, Janaka's daughter : in your absence today they are all glad as if they have got a Kingdom. How can you bear such rivalry? Why do you not reveal yourself quickly, my darling?\" In this way the Lord searched and lamented like an uxorious husband sore smitten with pangs of separation. Śrī Rāma, who is Bliss personified and has all His wishes accomplished, and who is both unborn and immortal, behaved like a mortal. Further on they saw the king of vultures lying, with his thoughts fixed on Śrī Rāma's feet which bear characteristic marks on their soles.†"

What more is wanting now, for which I should retain my body any longer?\" With His eyes full of tears the Lord of Raghus replied, \"Dear father, you have attained to an enviable state by virtue of your own noble deeds. Nothing is difficult of attainment in this world to those who have others' interests at heart. Casting off your body, dear father, proceed now to My divine abode.

I incessantly adore the all-merciful Śrī Rāma, the ornament of the earth, who is endowed with a form dark as the rain-cloud, a face resembling the blue lotus and large eyes resembling the red lotus. Possessed of long arms, He rids His devotees of the fear of transmigration. His strength is immeasurable; He is without beginning and unborn, the one (without a second), unmanifest and imperceptible, beyond the reach of the senses, though attainable with the help of the Vedic hymns, the dispeller of pairs of opposites (such as joy and sorrow, birth and death, pleasure and pain etc.,) consciousness personified, the supporter of the earth, death and the delighter of the soul of countless saints and devotees who repeat the sacred Name of Rāma. I ever extol Śrī Rāma, who loves and is loved by those who are free from desire and curbs the host of vicious propensities such as lust and so on. He, whom the Vedas glorify under the name of Brahma, pure (free from the taint of Māyā), all-pervading, passionless and unborn, whom the sages attain to through manifold practices such as meditation, discretion, dispassion and Yoga (self-discipline), that fountain of mercy has become manifest as the very incarnation of beauty and enraptures the whole animate and inanimate creation. He is the bee that resides in the lotus of my heart and through every limb of His shines the splendour of many a god of love. He, who is at once inaccessible and easily accessible, who has a guileless disposition and is both partial and impartial and ever placid, whom the Yogīs perceive with great effort subduing their senses and mind, that Rāma, the abode of Rāma (Goddess Lakṣmī) and the Lord of the three spheres (the entire creation) is ever at the beck and call of His devotees. May He abide in my heart, whose holy praises put a stop to transmigration.\""

Listen, Umā: those people are unfortunate indeed, who abandon Śrī Hari and become attached to the object of sense. The two brothers proceeded further in quest of Sītā and marked the thickening of the forest even as they went. The thicket was full of creepers and trees and inhabited by many birds and deer, elephants and lions, Śrī Rāma overthrew the demon Kabandha even as the latter met Him on the way; he told Him the whole story about the curse pronounced on him: \"The sage Dūrvāsa had imprecated me; the sin has now been wiped out by the sight of the Lord's feet.\" \"Listen, O Gandharva, to what I tell you: I cannot tolerate an enemy of the Brāhmaṇas.\""

            "A Brāhmaṇa, even though he curse you, beat you or speak harsh words to you, is still worthy of adoration: so declare the saints. A Brāhmaṇa must be respected, though lacking in amiability and virtue; not so a Śūdra, though possessing a host of virtues and rich in knowledge.\" The Lord instructed Kabandha in His own cult ( the cult of Devotion) and was delighted at heart to see his devotion to His feet. Having regained his original form (that of a Gandharva ) he bowed his head to the lotus feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of Raghus) and ascended to the heaven. Having conferred on him his own (Gandharva) state the beneficent Rāma repaired to the hermitage of Śabarī*. When Śabarī saw that Śrī Rāma had called at her abode, she recalled the words of the sage (Matanga)† and was glad of heart. With lotus-like eyes, long arms, a tuft of matted hair adorning their head like a crown and a garland of wild flowers hanging upon their breast, the two brothers looked most charming-the one dark of hue and the other fair; Śabarī fell prostrate and embraced their feet. She was so owerwhelmed with love that no words came to her lips. Again and again she bowed her head at their lotus feet. Presently she look some water and reverently laved their feet and then conducted them to a seat of honour."

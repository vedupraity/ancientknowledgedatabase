            "I reverence You, who are so fond of Your devotees, compassionate and gentle of disposition. I adore Your lotus feet, which vouchsafe to Your selfless lovers a quarter in Your own abode. You are possessed of an exquisitely beautiful swarthy form; You are Mount Mandara as it were to churn the ocean of mundane existence;You have eyes like the full-blown lotus and rid Your votaries of pride and other vices. Immense is the might of Your long arms and immeasurable Your glory. You carry on Your person a quiver, a bow and an arrow, O Lord of the three worlds ! The ornament of the solar race, You broke the bow of the great Lord Śiva. Delighting the greatest sages and saints, You crush the host of demons ( the enemies of gods ). You are an object of reverence to Lord Śiva, and are adored by Brahma and other divinities. An embodiment of pure consciousness, You destroy all evils. I bow to Lakṣmī's lord, the fountain of joy and the salvation of saints. I adore You with Your Spouse (Sītā) and younger brother (lakṣmaṇa), Yourself a beloved younger Brother* of Indra ( Sachi's lord). Men who worship the sole of Your feet and are free from jealousy sink not into the ocean of metempsychosis, turbulent with the billows of wrangling. They who, living in seclusion, constantly worship You with their senses and mind etc., fully subdued for the sake of attaining liberation are able to realize their own self. I adore Him, the mysterious Lord, who is one (without a second), desireless, all-powerful and omnipresent, the teacher of the world, eternal, transcending the three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) and absolute (self-existent). I adore Him who is fond of devotion, who is most difficult of access to sensually-minded strivers but who is a wish-yielding tree to His own devotees, nay, who is impartial and so easy to worship from day to day. I bow to Sītā's lord, King Rāma of matchless beauty. I reverence You; be gracious to me and grant me devotion to Your lotus feet. Men who recite this hymn with reverence undoubtedly attain Your abode, acquiring devotion to Your feet at the same time.\" (1-12)"

Who has struck off your nose and ears?\" \"Two sons of Daśaratha, the lord of Ayodhyā, who are lions among men, are out for hunting in the woods. The estimate that I have formed of their doing is that they will rid the earth of demons. Relying on the might of their arm, O ten-headed Rāvaṇa, the hermits roam about the woods without fear. Though quite young to look at, they are terrible as Death, the staunchest of archers and accomplished in many ways. Both brothers are unequalled in might and glory; devoted to the extermination of the wicked, they are a source of delight to gods and sages. The elder of the two who is an abode of beauty, is known by the name of Rāma; he has with him a young belle. The Creator made that woman the very embodiment of loveliness; a hundred million Ratis (consorts of the god of love) are trifles before her. It was his younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) who chopped off my ears and nose and made a mock of me when he heard that I was your sister. When Khara and Dūṣaṇa heard of it, they went to avenge the wrong done to me; but Rāma slew the whole army in a trice!\" The tenheaded demon (Rāvaṇa) burned all over (with rage) when he heard of the destruction of Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Trisira."

Lakṣmaṇa too did not know the secret of what the Lord had done behind the curtain. The ten-headed Rāvaṇa approached Mārīca and bowed his head to him, selfish and vile as he was.

When the monkeys heard that we were Ravana's (Your majesty's) spies, they bound us and persecuted us in many ways. They were about to cut off our ears and nose; but when we adjured them by Rama not to do so, they let us go. You have enquired, my lord, about Sri Rama's army; but a thousand million tongues would fail to describe it. It is a host of bears and monkeys of diverse hue and gruesome visage, huge and terrible. He who burnt your capital and killed your son (Aksa) is the weakest of all the monkeys. The army includes innumerable champions with as many names, fierce and unyielding monsters of vast bulk and possessing the strength of numberless elephants.\""

Abandon passion and give ear to my advice: my lord, avoid a clash with Sri Rama. The Hero of Raghu's line is exceedingly mild of disposition, even though He is the lord of the entire universe. The Lord will shower His grace on you the moment you meet Him, and will not take to heart even a single offence of yours. Pray, restore Janaka's Daughter to Sri Rama; at least concede this request of mine.\" When Suka asked him to surrender Videha's Daughter, the wretch kicked him. Suka, however, bowed his head at Ravana's feet and proceeded to the place where the all-merciful Lord of the Raghus was. Making obeisance to the Lord he told Him all about himself and by Rama's grace recovered his original state. He was an enlightened sage; it was by Agastya's curse, Parvati, that he had been transformed into a demon. Adoring Sri Rama's feet again and again the sage returned to his hermitage."

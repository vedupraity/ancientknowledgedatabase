Emboldened by His grace the monkey chiefs vied as it were with huge mountains equipped with wings. Śrī Rāma then sallied forth glad of heart and many were the delightful and auspicious omens that occurred to Him . It was in the fitness of things that good omens should appear at the time of His departure (on an expedition) whose glory itself embodies all blessings. Videha's Daughter came to know of the Lord's march; the throbbing of Her left limbs apprised Her of the same as it were. But what were good omens for Janaka's Daughter foreboded evil for Rāvaṇa.* Who could adequately describe the army as it marched with its countless monkeys and bears roaring. With no weapon other than their sharp claws, they carried rocks and trees (that they had uprooted on the way) and marched now in the air and now on land, for they had unhampered motion everywhere. The bears and monkeys roared like lions as they marched, while the elephants guarding the eight cardinal points shook and trumpeted."

Myriads of formidable monkey warriors gnashed their teeth (in a bellicose mood); while many more millions dashed forward crying \"Glory to Śrī Rāma, Kosala's lord, of mighty valour\" and hymning His praises. Even the great lord of serpents (Śeṣa) found himself unable to bear the crushing weight of the belligerent troops and felt dizzy again and again. But each time he would struggle by clutching with his teeth the hard shell of the divine Tortoise. The scratches thus made by his teeth would make one imagine as if, knowing the departure of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line) on His glorious expedition to be a most attractive theme, the serpent-king was inscribing its immortal and sacred story on the Tortoise's back."

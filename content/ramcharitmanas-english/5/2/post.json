He said, \"Suffering hardships and living on bulbs, roots and fruits, wait for me, brethren, till I return after seeing Sītā. I am sure our object will be accomplished as I feel very cheerful.\" So saying and after bowing his head to them all he set out full of joy with an image of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) enshrined in his heart. There was a beautiful hill on the seacoast; he lightly sprang on to its top. And invoking the Hero of Raghus line again and again, the son of the wind-god took a leap with all his might. The hill on which Hanumān planted his foot while leaping sank down immediately into the nethermost region (Pātāla). Hanumān sped forth in the same way as the unerring shaft of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). Knowing him to be Śrī Rāma's emissary, the deity presiding over the ocean spoke to mount Maināka,* \"Relieve him of his fatigue, O Maināka (by allowing him to rest on you).\" (1-5)"

Maināka, however, who was able to accelerate his speed with the help of the wind-god, rushed into the ocean and hid himself under its waters. The deity presiding over the ocean, who had been begotten by King Sagara, and was thus an ancestor of the Lord, took this opportunity to oblige Śrī Rāma and directed Maināka to come out of his hiding-place and give rest to His envoy in the mid-ocean so as to enable him to cross the ocean by easy stages. Out of gratitude to the ocean, who had afforded him shelter all the time, and in order to repay his obligation to the wind-god, Maināka emerged from his asylum and served as a stepping-stone for Hanumān to rest on and replenish his store of energy. Hanumān, however, who was spurred on by his devotion to Śrī Rāma and depended on His all-sufficient grace, needed no other support and took leave of the mountain by merely acknowledging his services. The incident further shows Hanumān's unremitting zeal in the service of his Lord."

Then I will approach you and enter your mouth; I tell you the truth. Mother, only let me go now.\" When, however, she would not let him go on any account, Hanumān said, \"Then why not devour me?\" She distended her mouth to a distance of eight miles, while the chief of monkeys grew double the size of her mouth. She stretched her mouth to a circumference of a hundred and twenty-eight miles, and the son of the wind-god immediately took a form covering two hundred and fifty-six miles. Even as Surasa expanded her jaws the chief of the monkeys manifested a form twice as large as her mouth. When she further expanded her mouth eight hundred miles wide, the son of the wind-god assumed a very minute form, by which he entered her mouth and came out again and bowing his head to her begged leave to proceed. \"I have gauged the extent of your wit and strength, the errand for which the gods had despatched me."

Seeing on the surface of the water the reflection of the creature that coursed in the air she would catch it and the bird was unable to move. In this way she would devour birds everyday. She employed the same trick against Hanumān, but the chief of monkeys at once saw through her game. The valiant son of the wind-god dispatched her and swept across the ocean, resolute of mind as he was. Reaching the other shore he gazed on the loveliness of the forest with the bees humming in quest of honey. Trees of various kinds looked charming with fruits and flowers; and he was particularly delighted at heart to see the numerous birds and beasts. Beholding a huge mountain ahead of him, he fearlessly ran up to its summit. The chief of the monkeys, O Umā (Pārvatī), deserved no credit for it: it was all attributable to the glory of the Lord, who devours Death himself. Climbing up the hill he surveyed Laṅkā, a most marvellous fortress that defied description. It was very high and was enclosed by the ocean on all sides. The ramparts of gold shed great lustre all round."

Fill your mind with indignation and dry up the ocean. Fate is a crutch for the mind of cowards alone; it is the indolent who proclaim their faith in fate.\" Hearing this the Hero of Raghu's line laughed and said, \"We shall do accordingly; pray, ease your mind.\" Reassuring His younger brother (lakṣmaṇa) with these words the Lord of the Raghus went to the seashore. First of all He bowed His head and greeted the ocean and then, spreading some Kusa grass on the shore, took His seat thereon. As soon as Vibhīṣaṇa proceeded towards the Lord, Rāvaṇa sent spies after him"

            "When the all-blissful Lord heard of Sītā's agony, tears rushed to his lotus eyes. \"Do you think anyone who depends on me in thought, word and deed can ever dream of adversity?\" Said Hanumān: \"There is no misfortune other than ceasing to remember and adore You. Of what account are the demons to You? Routing the enemy You will surely bring back Janaka's Daughter.\" \"No one endowed with a body-a god, human being or sage-has put me under such obligation, Hanumān, as you have done. Even my mind shrinks to face you; how, then, can I repay your obligation? Listen, my son: I have thought over the question and concluded that the debt which I owe you cannot be repaid.\" Again and again as the Protector of the gods gazed on Hanumān His eyes filled with tears and His body was overpowered with a thrill of emotion."

Gaurī's lord (Śiva) was overcome with emotion as He called to mind Hanumān's enviable lot.* But, recovering Himself, Śiva resumed the most charming narrative. The Lord lifted up Hanumān and clasped him to His bosom; then He took him by the hand and seated him very close to Him. \"Tell me, Hanumān, how could you burn Rāvaṇa's stronghold of Laṇkā, a most impregnable fortress?\" When Hanumān found the Lord so pleased, he replied in words altogether free from pride. \"A monkey's greatest valour lies in his skipping about from one bough to another. That I should have been able to leap across the ocean, burn the gold city, kill the demon host and lay waste the Asoka grove was all due to Your might; no credit, my lord, is due to me for the same.\""

Even he who takes this dialogue (between Śrī Rāma and Hanumān) to heart is blessed with devotion to Śrī Rāma's feet. On hearing the words of the Lord the whole host of monkeys cried, \"Glory, glory, all glory to the gracious Lord, the fountain of bliss !\" The Lord of the Raghus then summoned Sugrīva (the King of the monkeys) and said, \"Make preparations for the march. Why should we tarry any longer? Issue orders to the monkeys at once.\" The gods who were witnessing the spectacle rained down flowers in profusion and then gladly withdrew from the lower air to their own celestial spheres."

The next halt was made on the other bank of the Gaṅgā (at Śṛṅgaverapura) where Śrī Rāma's friend (Guha) made all arrangements for their comfort. Ferrying over the Sai they bathed in the Gomatī and reached Ayodhyā on the fourth day. King Janaka stayed in the capital for four days, looked after the state administration as well as all the state property and, entrusting the reins of government to the ministers, the Guru (the sage Vasiṣṭha) and Bharata, he left for Tirahuta (his capital) after making all necessary preparations.

            "His body thrilling all over (with emotion) and heart full of Sītā and Śrī Rāma, his tongue repeated Śrī Rāma's name and tears flowed from his eyes. Lakṣmaṇa, Śrī Rāma and Sītā dwelt in the forest; while Bharata mortified his flesh through austere penance even though living at home. After considering both sides, everyone said that Bharata was praiseworthy in everyway. Holy men felt abashed to hear of his religious vows and observances and the sight of his condition put the greatest of sages to shame. The most sanctifying story of Bharata's doing is delightful and charming and a fountain of joy and blessings. It drives away the terrible sins and afflictions of the Kali age; it is a veritable sun to disperse the night of the great delusion (which has thrown us into this world) and is a lion (the king of beasts) for crushing the herd of elephants in the shape of sins and allays all kinds of sufferings. It delights the devotees, relieves the burden of transmigration and is the essence of the moon of devotion to Śrī Rāma."

            "\"The wicked woman has played the axe in felling the tree of the solar race and plunged the whole universe in woe.\" The Nisada chief was sore distressed to see Rāma and Sītā sleeping on the ground. lakṣmaṇa spoke to him sweet and gentle words imbued with the nectar of wisdom, dispassion and devotion: \"No one is a source of delight or pain to another; everyone reaps the fruit of one's own actions, brother. Union and separation, pleasurable and painful experiences, friends, foes and neutrals-snares of delusion are these. Even so birth and death, prosperity and adversity, destiny and time and all the illusion of the world; lands, houses, wealth, town and family, heaven and hell, and all the phenomena of the world; nay, whatever is seen, heard or thought of with the mind has its root in ignorance: nothing exists in reality.\""

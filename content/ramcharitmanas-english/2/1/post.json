May the splendour of Sri Rama's lotus-like face, which neither grew brighter at the prospect of His being installed on the throne of Ayodhya nor was dimmed by the painful experience of exile in the woods, ever bring sweet felicity to me. I adore Sri Rama, the Lord of Raghu's race, whose limbs are as dark and soft as a blue lotus, who has Sita enthroned on His left side and who holds in His hands a mighty arrow and a graceful bow."

            "From the day Sri Rama returned home duly married, there was new festivity and jubilant music everyday. The fourteen spheres were like huge mountains on which clouds in the shape of meritorious deeds poured showers of joy. The water thus discharged formed into gorgeous rivers of affluence, success and prosperity, that rose in spate and flowed into the ocean of Ayodhya. The men and women of the city were like jewels of a fine quality, bright, priceless and charming in everyway. The splendour of the capital was beyond description; it seemed as if the Creator's workmanship had been exhausted there. Gazing on the moon-like face of Sri Ramacandra the citizens were all happy in everyway. All the mothers with their companions and maids were delighted to see the creeper of their heart's desire bear fruit. The king was particularly enraptured when he saw or heard of Sri Rama's beauty, goodness, amiability and genial disposition."

The sunlight can never exist apart from the sun nor can the radiance of the moon leave the moon.\" Having submitted Her loving entreaty to Her Lord, She spoke these charming words to the minister: \"You are as good to me as my own father or father-in-law; it is therefore most undesirable that I should urge something in reply.\""

He saw not with his eyes and heard not with his ears; and he was too agitated to speak. Śrī Rāma comforted him in many ways; yet his heart would not be pacified. He made many efforts even to accompany the Lord; but the Delighter of Raghus gave him suitable replies each time. Śrī Rāma's command could not be violated either. Cruel was the turn Fate had taken; there was no help. Bowing his head at the feet of Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā, he turned back as a merchant who had lost his capital."

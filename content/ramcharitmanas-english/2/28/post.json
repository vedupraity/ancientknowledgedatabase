There arrived many loads of sandal-wood and aloes and diverse other excellent aromatic herbs of untold varieties. The pile was raised in an artistic way on the bank of the Sarayū river, and looked like a lovely ladder reaching to heaven. In this way all the rites of cremation were gone through and then the funeral party bathed with due ceremony and offered a handful of water and sesame seeds to the departed soul. After ascertaining the views of all the Smrti texts, the Vedas and the Purāṇas Bharata performed the ceremony of Dasagatra.* Whatever orders the great sage Vasiṣṭha gave on a particular point Bharata carried out all of them in a thousand ways.

Then, after determining an auspicious date the great sage (Vasiṣṭha) came and summoned all the ministers as well as the elite of the city. They all repaired to the council chamber and sat there. The two brothers, Bharata and Śatrughna, were also sent for. Vasiṣṭha seated Bharata by his side and spoke to him words full of wisdom and piety. First of all the great sage repeated the whole story of Kaikeyī's wily doing and paid his tribute to the vow of piety and truthfulness of King Daśaratha, who remained true to his love even at the cost of his life. And as the great hermit spoke of Śrī Rāma's virtues, amiability and kind disposition tears came to his eyes and a thrill ran through his body. Again, when he extolled the affection that Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā bore (towards Rāma), the enlightened sage was overwhelmed with grief and emotion."

Of what account is this kingdom, which is nothing but an abode of sorrow, when the feet of Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma and Sītā are no longer to be seen? A load of jewels is of no use without clothes; an enquiry about Brahma (the Absolute) is of little use without dispassion; abundant enjoyments are of no use to a diseased body; of little use are Japa (muttering of prayers) and Yoga (exercises of mind-control) without devotion to Śrī Hari. A handsome body is of no use without life and all I have is naught without the Lord of Raghus. Grant me leave to go where Rāma is; my good exclusively lies in this. And if you urge that you seek your own good by crowning me king, you say so only through ignorance caused by affection.\""

Śrī Rāma has never injured even an enemy, to say nothing of me, a mere child and his servant too, though hostile to him.

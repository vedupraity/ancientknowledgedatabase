Tomorrow, I am installing Rama as the prince-regent; therefore, O bright-eyed dame, put on a festive garb.\" The queen's heart, hard though it was, cracked at these words; it seemed as if a festering sore had been unwarily touched. Even such (heart-rending) agony was disguised by her under the cloak of a smile. Just as a thief's wife does not openly weep (on seeing her husband suffer punishment lest she should be made to share his lot). The king was unable to detect her wily designs, tutored as she was by a teacher (Manthara) who ranked foremost among millions of villains. Although the king was skilled in statesmanship, the ways of a woman are like an unfathomable ocean.

And for the second boon I ask with joined palms-pray accomplish my desire, my lord: let Rama dwell in the woods for fourteen years in the garb of a hermit and wholly detached from the world.\" The king was grieved at heart to hear these gentle words even as a Cakravaka bird is filled with agony at the mere touch of a moonbeam. He felt dismayed and could not utter a word, like a partridge in the woods at the swoop of a falcon. The king turned altogether pale as a palm tree struck by lightning; with his hands to his forehead and closing both his eyes he began to mourn like Grief personified. \"The celestial tree of my desire, that had already blossomed, has been torn up with its roots by the elephant-like Kaikeyi just when it was about to bear fruit. She has desolated Ayodhya and laid the foundation of everlasting misfortune.\""

The two boons she had asked for represented its banks, her inexorable obstinacy corresponded to its (swift) current and the impelling force of Manthara's words stood for its eddies; uprooting the king like a tree the river headed towards the ocean of adversity. The king now perceived that the demand of the queen was really true, and that it was death itself which was dancing over his head in the disguise of his own consort. Clasping her feet he persuaded her to sit down and implored her, \"Pray do not play the axe with respect to the solar race. Ask of me my own head and I will forthwith give it to you; but kill me not by tearing Rama from me. Retain Rama by any means whatsoever, or your bosom will burn with anguish all your life.\""

Can both these things happen at the same time, O sovereign of the earth-to laugh a boisterous laugh and to look grave, to enjoy the reputation of being generous and yet be stingy? Is it possible to remain unscathed while playing the hero? Either go back upon your word or forbear; pray do not wail like a woman.

He felt so distressed with anxiety that his legs refused to move ahead. \"What will the king speak to Rama after calling him?\" he wondered. Recovering himself he repaired to the gate; and seeing him disconsolate all began to question him. He, however, reassured them all and proceeded to the apartment where the Ornament of the solar race (Sri Rama) was. When Sri Rama saw Sumantra coming. He received him with honour, treating the minister on an equal footing with His father. Looking Sri Rama in the face, Sumantra conveyed to Him the royal command and returned with the Light of Raghu's race (Sri Rama). Sri Rama followed the minister in an unbecoming manner: people here and there were grieved to see this."

Sri Rama was compassionate and soft by nature; He witnessed sorrow for the first time in His life, He had never heard of it before. Yet, recovering Himself as the occasion demanded, addressed His step-mother in the following sweet words, \"Tell me, dear mother, the cause of my father's distress, so that an attempt may be made to remove it.\" \"Listen, Rama; the sole cause is this: the king is very fond of you. He had promised me two boons of my choice and I asked whatever I liked. The king, however, was stricken with grief to hear my requests; for he cannot shake off the hesitation on your score.\""

In course of the night innumerable boats of untold varieties came from all the ghats. At daybreak the whole party crossed the river in a single trip; everyone was pleased with the services rendered by the Niṣāda chief in this behalf. After performing their ablutions and bowing their heads to the river (Yamunā) the two brothers (Bharata and Śatrughna) resumed their journey with the lord of Niṣādas. At the head of the line in chosen vehicles travelled the principal sages (Vāmadeva, Vasiṣṭha and so on), followed by the royal host. Next followed the two royal brothers, both on foot; their ornaments, costumes and style of dress were all of the very simplest. They were accompanied by their servants, friends and the minister's son and went with their thoughts fixed on Lakṣmaṇa, Sītā and the Lord of Raghus. They lovingly saluted each and every place where Śrī Rāma had either encamped or rested awhile."

Moreover, they do not wear a cheerful countenance and their heart is heavy with sorrow.

She lovingly narrated the whole episode as to how the festivities in connection with Śrī Rāma's installation had been obstructed.

Bharata and his whole host rejoiced at the thought that they would be able to see Śrī Rāma and the sting of their sorrows would come to an end. Each indulged in his own fancy and all went intoxicated with the wine of love; their limbs were getting out of control, their legs tottered and they spoke words in an incoherent way due to emotion. Śrī Rāma's friend (Guha) presently pointed to Bharata the crest-jewel of mountains (Kamadagiri), which was naturally charming and in the vicinity of which on the bank of the river Payasvini dwelt the two brothers (Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) alongwith Sītā. Catching sight of the mountain all fell prostrate on the ground with the cries of \"Glory to Śrī Rāma, the life of Janaka's daughter!\" The royal host was so overwhelmed with emotion as though the Chief of Raghu's line had turned back towards Ayodhyā."

Perceiving a suitable site and water close by they halted and at the close of night the beloved of Śrī Rāma resumed his journey. There Śrī Rāma awoke while it was yet dark. Sītā saw in a dream that very night as if Bharata had come with his retinue and that his body was tormented by the agony of separation from his lord. All who had accompanied him were sad at heart, miserable and afflicted; while Her mothers-in-law She found changed in appearance. On hearing of Sītā's dream Śrī Rāma's eyes filled with tears and He who rids others of their sorrow became sorrowful. \"This dream, Lakṣmaṇa, bodes no good; somebody will break terribly bad news.\" Saying so He took His bath with His brother and worshipping the Enemy of Tripura, Lord Śiva, paid His respects to holy men"

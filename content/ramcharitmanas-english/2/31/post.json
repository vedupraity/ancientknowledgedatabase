Bharata showed respect to all his mothers by kneading their feet and speaking to each in polite terms. Then entrusting his brother with the service of his mothers he himself summoned the Nisada chief and went hand in hand with him, his body overpowered with excess of love. He asked his friend to show him the spot-and thereby soothe the agony of his eyes and soul to some extent-where Sītā, Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa had slept at night. Even as he spoke the corners of his eyes were filled with tears. The Nisada chief was distressed to hear Bharata's words and presently took him to the spot-"

            "Bharata took comfort at the words of his friend and proceeded towards his lodgings with his thoughts directed towards the Hero of Raghu's race. On receiving this news the men and women of the city sallied forth to see the place (where Śrī Rāma had slept one night) much distressed at heart. Pacing round the spot clockwise they made obeisance to it and blamed Kaikeyī to their heart's content. Tears rushed to their eyes again and again and they reproached cruel Fate. Some would praise Bharata's love, while others said the king had vindicated his affection. They would reproach themselves and praise the Nisada chief; who can describe their confusion and woe? In this way they all kept vigil overnight and at daybreak the passage across the river began. The Guru was put on a good and handsome boat, and all the mothers on another newly-built one. In an hour and a half everyone was taken across. When Bharata had alighted, he made sure that all had come."

The Guru proceeded next alongwith the other Brāhmaṇas. He himself then made obeisance to the celestial river, invoked Sītā, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa and set forth on foot; while riding horses meant for the king were led by the bridle alongwith him. Again and again his faithful servants said, \"Be pleased, sire,to mount your horse.\" \"Śrī Rāma has gone on foot; while chariots, elephants and horses are intended for me! What behoves me is that I should walk on my head; for the duty of a servant is harder than any other duty.\" Seeing his behaviour and hearing his polite speech all his servants melted out of a feeling of self-disparagement."

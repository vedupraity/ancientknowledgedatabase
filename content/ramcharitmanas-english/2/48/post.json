Though knowing at heart that the day was auspicious (for undertaking a return journey to Ayodhya) the tender-hearted Sri Rama hesitated to say so. Sri Rama looked at His preceptor (the sage Vasistha), King Janaka and the assembly; but the very next moment He felt nervous and turned His eyes to the ground. Praising His regard for others' feelings the whole assembly thought that nowhere could one find a master so considerate as Sri Rama. Bharata, who was clever enough to perceive Sri Rama's wish, lovingly rose and imposing great restraint upon himself fell prostrate on the ground. Then, joining his palms, he lovingly said,\"My lord, you have granted me all my desires. For my sake everybody has suffered a good deal of trouble and you too have been put to much inconvenience. Now, my lord, give me your permission to leave, so that I may go back to Ayodhya and remain there till your return.\""

            "That mischief, however, proved a boon to all; it helped to sustain their life like the hope of Sri Rama's returning to Ayodhya on the expiry of His term of exile. Otherwise people would have succumbed to the fell disease of separation from Laksmana, Sita and Rama in great agony. By Sri Rama's grace the imbroglio was resolved and the gods, who were hostilely disposed (towards the people of Ayodhya), now turned out helpful as allies. Sri Rama locked His brother, Bharata, in a close embrace; the ecstasy of His love cannot be described in words. His body, mind and speech overflowed with love and the firmest of the firm lost all firmness. His lotus eyes streamed with tears; even the assembly of gods was grieved to see His condition. The host of sages (assembled there), the preceptor (the sage Vasistha) and a champion of firmness like Janaka, the gold of whose mind had been tested in the fire of wisdom, nay, who were created by Brahma as free from all attachment and were born in this world even as the lotus springs up from water (and yet remains ever above it)-"

People would account the poet hard-hearted if they heard him describe the parting of Sri Rama (the Chief of Raghus) and Bharata. The rapture of that delicacy was past all telling; thinking of the love that manifested itself on the occasion even eloquence shrunk into itself. Sri Rama (the Chief of Raghus) first embraced Bharata and consoled him; and then He gladly clasped Satrughna to His bosom. Reading Bharata's mind his servants and ministers all left and set about their respective duties. The people in both the camps were sore distressed to learn this and began to prepare for the return journey. The two brothers (Bharata and Satrughna) adored the lotus-feet of their lord and bowing to the orders of Sri Rama they set out on their journey. They supplicated the sages, ascetics and sylvan gods and honoured them again and again."

Experiencing a thrill of joy they lovingly said to one another, \"The omens prognosticate Bharata's return. Many days have passed and our heart longs to meet him. Auspicious omens assure us of our meeting with a beloved friend, and in this world there is no one so dear to us as Bharata; the good omens can thus have but one meaning.\" Śrī Rāma anxiously remembered His half-brother (Bharata) day and night, even as a turtle has its heart fixed on its eggs."

The rejoicing that was going on in Ayodhyā did not please them even as a moonlit night is not liked by a thief. Invoking Śāradā the gods supplicated her and laying hold of her feet fell at them again and again."

Seeing her downcast the gods spoke again in a suppliant tone, \"Mother, not the least blame will attach to you; for the Lord of Raghus is above sorrow and joy alike. You are fully acquainted with Śrī Rāma's glory. As for the people, every embodied soul is subject to pleasure and pain according to its fate. Therefore, you should go to Ayodhyā for the good of the celestials.\" Clasping her feet again and again they exerted great pressure on her till she yielded and set out, considering the gods as mean-minded. She said to herself, \"Though their abode is on high, their doings are mean; they cannot see others prosperity.\" Again, reflecting on the role she was destined to perform in the days to come, when worthy poets would seek her favour, she came with a cheerful heart to the capital of Daśaratha like the intolerably evil influence of a planet."

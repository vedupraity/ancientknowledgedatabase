The demon Hiraṇyākṣa in the form of grief had carried away the globe in the shape of the assembly's wit, which was the source of the entire creation in the form of a host of virtues, when the gigantic boar of Bharata's discretion playfully delivered the same in no time†. Bharata bowed his head and joined his palms before all and thus prayed to Śrī Rāma, King Janaka, his preceptor (the sage Vasiṣṭha) and other holy men present there, \"With my juvenile lips I am going to make a harsh statement. Kindly forgive today this most unbecoming act of mine.\" He now invoked in his heart the charming goddess Śāradā, who came from the Mānasarovara lake of his mind to his lotus-like mouth. Bharata's speech, which was full of pure wisdom, piety and prudence, resembled a lovely cygnet (in that it possessed the virtue of sifting goodness from evil)."

And the greatest service to a noble master is to obey his orders. Let your servant, my lord, obtain this favour (in the form of an order).\" So saying he was utterly overwhelmed with emotion; a thrill ran through his body and tears rushed to his eyes. In great distress he clasped the Lord's lotusfeet; the excitement of the moment and the intensity of affection cannot be described in words. The Ocean of Compassion honoured him with kind words and taking him by the hand seated him by His side. The whole assembly including the Lord of Raghus Himself was overpowered by love after hearing Bharata's entreaty and seeing his disposition."

Having conceived an evil design in the first instance he wove a net of wiles and made everyone a victim of ennui by throwing the net on the head of each. He then infatuated all by exerting the deluding potency of the gods; but they could not be wholly deprived of the affection they bore for Śrī Rāma. Overcome as they all were by fear and ennui, they were all distracted. Now they conceived a liking for the woods and the very next moment they loved to be at their home. The people were afflicted by this vacillating attitude of their mind even as the water at the mouth of a river is tossed on both sides. Wavering in mind, they did not derive solace anywhere nor did they disclose their heart to one another. Observing this, the all-compassionate Lord smiled within Himself and said, \"The canine race, Indra and reckless youth are alike* in nature.\""

The assembly, King Janaka, the preceptor (the sage Vasiṣṭha), the other Brāhmaṇas and the ministers, all had their wits hampered by Bharata's devotion (to Śrī Rāma). Like figures drawn in a painting they regarded Śrī Rāma and uttered with diffidence words which they had been taught to repeat as it were. Bharata's affection, courtesy, modesty and nobility were delightful to hear but difficult to describe. Seeing a minute particle of his devotion the host of sages and the King of Mithilā were absorbed in love; how, then, can I, Tulasīdāsa, speak of his glory? It is his devotion and noble sentiments that have inspired sublime thoughts in the poet's mind. When it came to know of its own poverty and the magnitude of Bharata's glory, it shrank into itself out of respect for the barriers imposed by the race of bards. Though greatly enamoured of his virtues it is unable to describe them; the poet's wit finds itself as helpless as an infant's speech."

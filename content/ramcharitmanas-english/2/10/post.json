Janaka's Daughter then threw Herself at Her mother-in-law's feet and said, \"I tell you, mother: I am most unluckly in that at a time when I should have served you heaven has exiled me to the forest and has refused to grant my desire. Pray be not perturbed any more but at the same time cease not to entertain kindly feelings towards me. Relentless is fate and there is no fault of mine either.\" The mother-in-law was so distressed to hear Sita's words that I have no words to describe her condition. Again and again she pressed her Daughter-in-law to her breast and recovering herself admonished and blessed Her: \"May the blessed state of your wifehood (the longevity of your husband) know no break and endure so long as the streams of the Ganga and Yamuna continue to flow.\""

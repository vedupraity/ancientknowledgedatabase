There was anxiety in his heart. \"What is going to happen, O good heavens?\" he said to himself. \"All my joy and merits are over now. What will the Lord of Raghus command me to do? Will he leave me at home or take me with him? \"When Śrī Rāma saw His brother with joined palms having renounced his home and reckless about his own body, He addressed him in the following words, wellversed as He was in the rules of correct behaviour and an ocean of amiability, love, artlessness and joy: \"Pray do not lose your balance of mind out of affection, dear brother, and be convinced in your heart of hearts that the end will be a happy one.\""

Stay, then, to comfort all; otherwise, brother, we shall incur great sin. A king whose reign brings suffering to his beloved people surely deserves an abode in hell. Bearing in mind this maxim, dear brother, stay at home.\" Hearing this, Lakṣmaṇa felt much distressed.

Approaching her he bowed his head at her feet, while his heart was with Śrī Rāma (the Delighter of Raghu's race) and Janaka's Daughter. Finding him depressed in spirit the mother inquired the reason, when Lakṣmaṇa related at length the whole incident. Sumitrā was alarmed to hear this cruel report as a doe on finding wild fire all about her. Lakṣmaṇa apprehended that things would take a wrong turn that day and that his mother would frustrate his plans due to her affection. He, therefore, felt nervous and hesitated in asking leave of her; for he thought within himself, \"Good God, will she allow me to accompany Śrī Rāma or not?\""

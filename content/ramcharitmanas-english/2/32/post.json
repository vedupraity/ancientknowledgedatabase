Abandoning the course of conduct prescribed for a Kṣatriya I beg alms of you. But what vile act is there that an afflicted soul would not stoop to?

The cloud may neglect the Cātaka bird all its life and on its asking water may discharge thunderbolt and hail.

Just as gold gets brighter by being put into the fire, even so the lover shines by sticking to his vow of devotion to the feet of his most beloved lord.\" In response to Bharata's prayer there came a sweet and benedictory utterance from the midst of the Triveṇī: \"Dear Bharata, you are pious in everyway and your love for Śrī Rāma's feet is unbounded. In vain do you harbour depressing thoughts in your mind; there is no one so dear to Rāma as you are.\""

I tell you, Bharata, there is no one held so dear in his heart by the Chief of Raghu's line as you. Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma and Sītā most fondly praised you the whole night. I came to know the secret only when they were bathing at Prayāga; they would feel overwhelmed with love for you. The Chief of Raghu's line cherishes the same love for you as a fool does for a life of ease in this world. This is, however, no great tribute to the Hero of Raghu's race, who cherishes the whole family of the suppliant.

My mother's evil counsel was like a sinful carpenter, who used my interests as an adze and fashioned out of the inauspicious wood of discord a destructive magical contrivance and muttering the terrible malevolent spell of (Śrī Rāma's) exile for a fixed term (of fourteen years) planted it (in the soil of Ayodhyā).* It is for my sake that she employed this infamous contrivance and brought ruin on the whole world. This calamity will cease only when Śrī Rāma returns; by no other means can Ayodhyā thrive again.\" The sage (Bharadvāja) was gratified to hear Bharata's words and everyone applauded him in ways more than one. \"Grieve not much, dear child; all your woes will disappear the moment you behold Śrī Rāma's feet.\""

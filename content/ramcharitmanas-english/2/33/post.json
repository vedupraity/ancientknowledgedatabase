Every house was supplied with a celestial cow (the cow of plenty) and a tree of paradise; Indra (the king of gods) and his consort, Śacī, grew covetous at their sight. It was the vernal season and a cool, fragrant and gentle breeze was blowing. Everyone had all the four prizes of life (viz., religious merit, worldly riches, sensuous enjoyment and final beatitude) within one's easy reach. At the sight of luxuries like garlands, sandal-paste and women the guests were overcome by a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow (joy at the unique hospitality shown by the sage by dint of his Yogic powers and sorrow because at a time when they should abstain from luxuries of every kind they were being offered the same)."

Holding Śrī Rāma's friend (Guha) by the hand he walked along like the very incarnation of love. He had no shoes and no umbrella over his head; and his love, self-discipline, austerity and piety were unfeigned. He asked his friend (Guha) to give an account of the wanderings of Lakṣmaṇa, Śrī Rāma and Sītā; while Guha narrated the same in soft accents. When he saw the spots where Śrī Rāma had rested and the trees under which he had halted the emotion within his breast could not be repressed. The gods who beheld his condition rained down flowers; the earth grew soft and the road became pleasant."

This was no great thing for Bharata, whom Śrī Rāma ever cherished in His heart. \"Even they who utter the name of Rāma only once in this world not only reach the other shore themselves but are also able to take others across. As for Bharata, he is dearly loved by Śrī Rāma and is His younger brother too. No wonder, then, that the journey should be delightful to him,\" Siddhas (a class of celestial beings), saints and great sages observed thus and rejoiced at heart to behold Bharata. Indra (the chief of gods) was filled with anxiety when he saw Bharata's power. The world is good to the good and vile for the vile. He said to his preceptor (the sage Bṛhaspati), \"Something must be done, my lord, to prevent the meeting between Rāma and Bharata.\""

Finding a guest as dear to him as life itself the holy sage sent for delicious bulbs, roots and fruits. Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa and Rāma partook of those fruits and the sage then assigned them beautiful quarters. Great was the joy of Vālmīki's heart as he beheld with his own eyes Śrī Rāma, who was bliss personified. Joining His lotus palms the Lord of Raghus then spoke to him in words which were delightful to the ears. \"You directly perceive everything relating to the past, present and future, O lord of sages; the whole universe is as if in the palm of your hand.\" Saying so the Lord related to him the whole story as to how the queen (Kaikeyī) had exiled Him into the woods."

It is a side stream of the Gaṅgā and is known by the name of Mandākinī-which is quick to destroy sins even as a witch strangles infants.

Wend Your way thither, Rāma, and reward the labours of all, conferring dignity on this great mountain as well.\""

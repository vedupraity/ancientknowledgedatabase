This king has Truth for his minister, Piety for his beloved consort and a beneficent friend like Bindumādhava (the Deity presiding over Prayāga). His treasury is replete with the four prizes of human life, while the sacred region surrounding the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā marks his most beautiful dominion. The holy Prayāga represents his inaccessible, strong and lovely fortress that no enemy has ever dreamt of possessing. All the sacred spots are his chosen and valiant warriors, who are staunch in battle and capable of crushing the host of sins. The confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā constitutes his exquisite throne, while the immortal banyan tree (known by the name of Akṣayavaṭa) represents his royal umbrella, which captivates the heart even of sages. The waves of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā constitute his chowries, whose very sight destroys sorrow and want."

With His own gracious lips He told Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa and His friend (Guha) the greatness of Prayāga. Making obeisance to this holy place He cast a look round the groves and gardens and expatiated on its glory with the utmost devotion. In this way he arrived at and saw the confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā, the very thought of which bestows all choice blessings. After bathing in the confluence He gladly adored Lord Śiva and worshipped the deities presiding over the holy Prayāga according to the prescribed ritual. The Lord then called on Bharadvāja; and the sage clasped Him to his bosom as He fell prostrate before him. The joy that the sage felt within his heart cannot be described in words; it looked as if he had found the bliss of oneness with Brahma incarnate."

They all cherished boundless love for Śrī Rāma and each of them said he had seen the path. The sage then sent with the royal party four religious students who had practised all kinds of virtues in a series of previous births. Making obeisance to the sage and receiving his permission the Lord of Raghus proceeded with a cheerful heart. As the party passed by some village men and women of the village ran to have a look at them. They felt gratified in having attained the fruit of their life and returned disconsolate sending their heart after the strangers."

            "Hearing of their arrival the people inhabiting the river banks ran to see them unmindful of their duties. Beholding the beauty of Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma and Sītā they congratulated themselves on their good luck. Their hearts were seized with intense longing, but they felt shy in enquiring the names and residence of the newcomers. Such of them, however, as were advanced in years and intelligent were able to recognize Rāma by dint of their wit. They related to them the whole story telling them how Śrī Rāma had proceeded to the woods in obedience to His father's commands. They were all sad to hear this and lamented: \"The king and queen have not done well.\" In the meantime there arrived an ascetic who was an embodiment of spiritual glow, young in years and charming in appearance. His ways were unknown to the poet; he was attired in the garb of a recluse and was devoted to Rāma in thought, word and deed."

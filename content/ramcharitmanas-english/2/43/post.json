In the meantime Sita's mother (Queen Sunayana) despatched her handmaids to King Dasaratha's queens; and perceiving that it was a convenient hour they returned with that information. Having learnt that Sita's mothers-in-law were at leisure the ladies of King Janaka's gynaeceum called on them. Queen Kausalya (Sri Rama's mother) received them with due honour and courtesy and offered them such seats as circumstances would permit. The amiability and affection of all on both sides were such as would have made even the hardest thunderbolt melt if it could be see or hear of them. With their body thrilling all over and overpowered by emotion and eyes full of tears all began to sorrow and scratch the ground with the nails of their toes. They were all incarnations as it were of love for Sita and Sri Rama; it seemed as if Pathos herself mourned in so many forms. Said Sita's mother, \"The intellect of Providence is so marvellous that He has thought fit to break up the foam of milk with a chisel of adamant!"

The enexorable ways of Providence are known to God alone, who dispenses all kinds of fruits, both good and evil. God's commands prevail over all, including the processes of creation, maintenance and dissolution and even over poison and nectar (which destroy and restore life respectively). It is no use lamenting, O good lady, out of infatuation. The doings of Providence are, as I have said, immutable and eternal. If we mourn over the contrast between the king's lifetime and his loss, my friend, it is because we see that our interests have suffered on account of his demise.\" Sita's mother replied, \"Your noble words are quite true, a spouse that you are of Ayodhya's lord, who was the greatest of all virtuous souls known to history.\""

Great men treat with honour even the lowest of their servants: fire is crowned with smoke, while mountains bear grass on their tops. The king (of Mithila) is your servant in thought, word and deed; while the great Lord Siva and His Consort (Bhavani) are your constant helpers. Who on this earth is worthy of serving as your auxiliary? Can an ordinary light ever pose with any grace as a helper of the sun? After serving the term of his exile in the woods and accomplishing the object of the gods Sri Rama will reign undisturbed at Ayodhya; and protected by Sri Rama's strength of arm gods, Nagas and human beings will dwell peacefully in their own abodes. This has all been predicted by the sage Yajnavalkya and a sage's prophesy, madam, can never go in vain.\""

When they saw Janaki (Janaka's Daughter) in the robes of an ascetic everybody was stricken with deep sorrow. Receiving the permission of Sri Rama's preceptor, Vasistha, King Janaka too left for his camp and on arrival found Sita there. The king clasped Janaki to his bosom-Janaki who was an honoured guest of his unalloyed love and life. In his heart welled up an ocean of love and the king's heart now appeared like the holy Prayaga. The immortal banyan tree in the shape of affection for Sita was seen growing with the divine babe of love for Sri Rama adorning its top. The long-lived sage (Markandeya)* in the shape of King Janaka's wisdom was greatly bewildered and was just going to be drowned when lo! he found his support in the divine babe and was saved. Really speaking, it was not that Videha's wit was lost in infatuation; it was the triumph of the affection he bore for Sita and the Chief of Raghus."

The river of your fame outshone the celestial stream (Ganga) in that it has penetrated (not only one solar system but) millions of universes. While the Ganga has (in the course of its career) exalted only three places,* the river of your fame has added to the glory of numerous congregations of holy men.\" Even though Her father made these flowery yet truthful remarks out of affection for Her, Sita was drowned as it were in a sea of bashfulness. Her parents pressed Her to their bosom once more and gave Her good and salutary advice and blessing. Sita did not speak but felt uncomfortable in Her mind because She thought that it was not good to remain with Her parents overnight. Reading Her mind the queen (Sunayana) made it known to the king (her husband) and both admired in their heart Her modesty and noble disposition."

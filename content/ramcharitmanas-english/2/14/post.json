The city resembled an extensive and thick forest full of fruits and the many men and women residing therein represented so many birds and beasts. God assigned Kaikeyī the role of a Bhīla woman who set the whole forest in a fierce blaze. The people could not bear the fire of separation from the Chief of Raghus and they all ran away in distress. They all came to this conclusion in their mind: \"There can be no happiness without Rāma, lakṣmaṇa and Sītā. The whole community will live where Rāma takes up his abode; without the Hero of Raghu's race we have no business in Ayodhyā.\" Having thus firmly resolved they followed Him forsaking their happy homes, which were the envy of gods. Can the pleasures of sense overpower those who hold the lotus feet of Śrī Rāma dear to their heart?"

Addressing them in affectionate, soft and agreeable tones, He comforted all in ways more than one. He also gave them varied instructions in their moral duty; but overmastered by love they would not turn back even though urged to return. Śrī Rāma could not afford to take leave of His amiable disposition and loving nature; the Lord of Raghus thus found Himself in a fix. Overpowered by grief and toil the people fell asleep and the deluding potency of gods further helped to benumb their mind. When two watches of the night had passed, Śrī Rāma addressed the minister in endearing terms, \"Father, drive the chariot in such a way as to mix up the tracks; by no other means can our object be accomplished.\""

They condemned themselves and praised the fish (that died as soon as they were taken out of water), and said to one another; \"A curse on our life without the Hero of Raghu's race! If God has torn us from our beloved, why did He not vouchsafe death to us on our asking?\" Thus wailing in a variety of ways they all returned to Ayodhyā full of remorse. The anguish of parting was terrible beyond words. Everyone survived in the hope of seeing Rāma on the expiry of the term of exile."

They took a plunge in the river and the fatigue of the journey was gone; and their hearts rejoiced when they drank of its holy water. That He whose very thought relieves the great toil of transmigration should feel fatigued shows that He imitated the ways of the world."

Those who are devoted to the lotusfeet of their preceptor are highly blessed from the point of view of the world as well as of the Vedas.

To my mind, men of holy reputation in all the three spheres of creation and belonging to the past, present and future are pygmies before you, my darling. He who attributes malevolence to you even in his heart will be ruined in this world as well as in the next.

Birds and beasts draw close to hermits, while they run away at the very sight of a hunter who torments them. Even beasts and birds can distinguish between a friend and a foe, to say nothing of the human body, which is a storehouse of virtue and knowledge. I know you full well, dear brother; but what am I to do ? There is great perplexity in my mind. The king (our father), you know, kept his word and abandoned me; nay, he gave up his life in order to keep his vow of love. I feel perturbed in my mind if I proceed to violate his word; and my scruple on your account is even greater. On top of it my preceptor has given his command to me.

The Guru (the sage Satananda), the members of the royal family, the ministers and the king himself were all overpowered with grief and affection at the report. Then, collecting himself and gloryfying Bharata, the king summoned his chosen warriors and equerries and, posting guards at the palaces, city and realm got ready a number of horses, elephants, chariots and other conveyances. After ascertaining a lucky period within an hour* he started at once and did not halt on the way. Having bathed at Prayāga this very morning, he has already left the place; and when the whole party began to cross the Yamunā, they despatched us ahead for obtaining news, holy sir.\" So saying they bowed their head to the ground. The great sage Vasistha dismissed the messengers at once, sending with them an escort of six or seven Kiratas."

            "When Sri Rama received the news about the enemy, He summoned all His counsellors by His side. \"Lanka has four massive gates; take counsel as to how we should assail them.\" Thereupon the monkey lord (Sugriva), Jambavan (the king of bears) and Vibhisana (Ravana's brother) invoked in their heart the Ornament of the solar race; and putting their heads together they resolved upon a definite plan. They divided the monkey host into four brigades and appointed efficient generals to each. They then summoned all the company commanders and bringing the Lord's might home to them issued instructions hearing which the monkeys rushed forward roaring like lions. They gladly bowed their head at Sri Rama's feet, and with mountain-peaks in their hands all the heroes sallied forth. Shouting, \"Glory to the Hero of Raghu's line, the Lord of Kosala\" the bears and monkey chiefs roared and assumed a threatening attitude. Even though they knew that Lanka was a most impregnable fortress, the monkeys marched forward undaunted depending on the might of their lord. Encompassing all the four quarters like a mass of clouds spreading over the horizon on all sides, they imitated the sound of drums and kettledrums with their mouth."

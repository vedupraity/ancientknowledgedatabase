God has provided them with a meal even at their home.\" So saying the idiot burst into a horselaugh. \"Sally forth in every direction, champions all; and wherever you find the bears and monkeys seize and devour them all.\" Umā, Rāvaṇa's conceit was as great as that of the sandpiper, which goes to sleep with its legs in the air (and thinks that it will support the heavens in case they fall). Taking his orders, the demons sallied forth, armed with excellent slings, javelins, iron clubs and maces, fierce axes, pikes, swords, bludgeons and masses of rock in their hands. As foolish carnivorous birds swoop down upon a heap of rubies the moment they see it, and have no idea of the pain they would have on breaking their beaks against it, so did the man-eating monsters rush forth in their folly."

Gnashing their teeth and biting their lips, myriads of warriors on both sides roared and bullied, calling here on Rāma and there on Rāvaṇa.

Where are the mighty Nala, Nila and Dvivida?\" At the time Hanumān heard that his troops were breaking, that mighty warrior held his position at the western gate of Laṇkā, where Meghanada led the defence. The gate, however, would not give way and Hanumān was faced with a mighty impediment. The son of the wind-god grew terribly furious at heart and the warrior, who was formidable as death, gave a loud roar. He sprang and reached the fort of Laṇkā; and seizing a rock he rushed at Meghanada, shattered his chariot, overthrew the charioteer and kicked Meghanada himself at his chest. Another charioteer, who perceived the distress of the prince, picked him up in his own chariot and speedily brought him home."

Man-eating monsters who feasted on the flesh of holy Brāhmaṇas thus attained a destiny which is solicited even by Yogīs (ascetics given to contemplation on God). Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) Śrī Rāma is so tender-hearted and such a storehouse of compassion that He bestows the highest state (final beatitude) even on the demons, remembering that they think of Him even though in a spirit of hostility! Tell me, Bhavānī, who else is so benignant? Most dull-witted and utterly wretched are the men who, even on hearing of such a lord, worship Him not, disabusing themselves of all delusion. \"Aṅgada and Hanumān have evidently forced their way into the fort of Laṇkā,\" thus observed Ayodhyā's lord.

On learning that Aṅgada and Hanumān had left, the numerous monkey and bear warriors retired from the field; while the demons, recovering their strength at nightfall, sallied forth, calling on their ten-headed lord. At the sight of the demon host the monkeys turned again; and gnashing their teeth in fury the champions closed with their opponents here and there. The two armies stood formidable; their champion's challenging one another every time, came to a grim fight without giving in. The demons were all great warriors and dark in complexion; while the monkeys were stupendous in size and of numerous colours. The two armies were equally strong and the warriors too equally matched; displaying their martial feats they fought with fury and looked like masses of rainy and autumnal clouds driven against one another by a strong wind. The generals Akampana and Atikaya (sons of Rāvaṇa), when they perceived their troops losing ground, employed Māyā (illusive devices); in an instant it grew pitch dark and there was a downpour of blood, stone and ashes."

The bear and monkeys were relieved of their fatigue and rid of all fear when they saw light again, and pressed on exultingly.

But the bears and monkeys seized the demon warriors in their flight and dashed them to the ground, performing marvellous feats of strength even as they did so, or catching them by the leg, hurled them into the ocean, where alligators, serpents and fish snapped them up and devoured them."

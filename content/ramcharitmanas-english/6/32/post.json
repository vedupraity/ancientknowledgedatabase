Vibhīṣaṇa gave prompt instructions to the demonesses, who washed Her body in all possible ways. They also decked Her with ornaments of every description and then brought a beautiful palanquin duly equipped. Videha's Daughter gladly mounted it with Her thoughts fixed on the all-blissful Rāma, Her loving lord. Guards marched on all four sides, staves in hand; they were all supremely delighted at heart. The bears and monkeys all came to have a look at Her; but the guards darted in a fury to keep them back. Said the Hero of Raghu's line, \"Follow my advice, Vibhīṣaṇa and bring Sītā on foot.\" \"Let the monkeys gaze on Her as they would on their own mother,\" smilingly added the Almighty Lord of the Raghus. The bears and monkeys rejoiced to hear the Lord's words, while from the heavens the gods rained down flowers in profusion. Sītā (it will be remembered) had been previously lodged in fire (vide Araṇyakāṇda XXIII. 1-2); Śrī Rāma (the inner Witness of all) now sought to bring Her back to light."

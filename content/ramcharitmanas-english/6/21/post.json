Complete in all its four limbs, viz., elephants and chariots, horse and foot, it was divided into many regiments and was equipped with mounts, cars and other conveyances of every description as well as with numerous banners and standards of diverse colour. Numberless troops of infuriated elephants marched like rainy clouds driven by the wind. There were multitudes of distinguished warriors wearing uniforms of various colours, all heroic in battle and conversant with many illusive devices. Thus the army was magnificent in every way and looked like the mustered array of the gallant deity presiding over the vernal season. Even as the host marched, the elephants guarding the eight quarters tottered, the ocean was stirred to its very depth and the mountains rocked. The dust rose in clouds that obscured the sun, the air became still and the earth was troubled. Drums and kettledrums made an awful din like the thundering of clouds at the time of universal destruction. Tabors, clarionettes and hautboys sounded the martial strain that gladdens the heart of champions. All the heroes roared like lions, each extolling his own might and valour. Ravana exclaimed; \"Listen, my valiant warriors: wipe out the hordes of these bears and monkeys, while I shall slay the two brother princes.\" So saying he ordered his army to march forward. When the monkeys received this news, they all rushed forth invoking the help of Sri Rama."

How, then, can You expect to conquer this mighty hero?\" \"Listen, friend:\" replied the All-merciful, \"the chariot which leads one to victory is quite another. Valour and fortitude are the wheels of that chariot, while truthfulness and good conduct are its enduring banner and standard. Even so strength, discretion, self-control and benevolence are its four horses, that have been joined to the chariot with the cords of forgiveness, compassion and evenness of mind. Adoration of God is the expert driver; dispassion, the shield and contentment, the sword. Again, charity is the axe; reason, the fierce lance and the highest wisdom, the relentless bow. A pure and steady mind is like a quiver; while quietude and the various forms of abstinence (Yamas) and religious observances (Niyamas) are a sheaf of arrows. Homage to the Brahmanas and to one's own preceptor is an impenetrable coat of mail; there is no other equipment for victory as efficacious as this. My friend, he who owns such a chariot of piety shall have no enemy to conquer anywhere.\""

They ripped up bellies, plucked up arms and, seizing the opponent by the foot, dashed him to the ground. The bears buried the demon warriors underground and piled over them large heaps of sand.

Taking in their hands trees, stones and rocks, they hurled them upon him all at once. The rocks broke to pieces the moment they struck his adamantine frame. Ravana, who was maddened with the lust for war and most furious by temperament, flinched not but remained firm as a rock, planting his chariot where it stood. Burning all over with rage he darted and bullied hither and thither and started crushing the monkey warriors. Many a bear and monkey took to his heel, crying: \"Help, help, Angada and Hanuman! Save, save, O Lord Raghuvira (Hero of Raghu's line)! This wretch is devouring us like Death.\" When the monster saw that all the monkeys had fled, he fitted an arrow to each of his ten bows."

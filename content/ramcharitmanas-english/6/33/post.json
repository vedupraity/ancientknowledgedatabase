This sensual wretch, who took delight in doing mischief to the whole world and trod the evil way, has perished through his own sins. You are alike to all, the imperishable Brahma, ever unchangeable, impartial by nature, integral, devoid of material properties, unborn, sinless, immutable, invincible, unfailing in power, and full of compassion. It was You who assumed the form of a fish, a tortoise; a boar, a man-lion and a dwarf as well as that of Paraśurāma. Whenever, O Lord, the gods have been in trouble, You have put an end to it by appearing in one form or other. This impure wretch, a perpetual enemy of the gods, was given up to lust, greed and vanity, and very passionate too. That even this vilest creature attained Your state is a marvel to us. We gods are supremely qualified (for the highest state): yet, devoted as we are to our own selfish ends, we have forgotten the worship of our lord and are ever involved in the flood of birth and death. Now redeem us, O Lord, since we have sought shelter in You.\""

            "\"Glory to You, O Rāma, perpetual abode of bliss. O Hari (the reliever of suffering), O Chief of the Raghus, bearing a bow and arrows! Lord, You are a veritable lion to tear in pieces the elephant of mundane existence, and an ocean of virtues, my clever and omnipresent Master. In Your person stands concentrated the incomparable beauty of a myriad Cupids; Siddhas, as well as the greatest of sages and bards sing Your praises. Your glory is not only sacred, it purifies all; in Your wrath You seized Rāvaṇa even as Garuḍa (the king of the birds) might seize a huge serpent. Delight of devotees, and dispeller of their grief and fear, You are ever unmoved by passion, and are all- intelligence, my lord. Your descent on the mortal plane is beneficent and full of untold virtues: You come to relieve Earth's burdens and Your manifestations on earth are wisdom personified. (Though descended on earth,) You are ever unborn, omnipresent, one (without a second) and beginningless. I gladly bow to You, O Rāma, fountain of mercy ! Ornament of Raghu's race and Slayer of demon Dμusana (Rāvaṇa's Cousin), You eradicate the faults of Your devotees and made Vibhīṣaṇa, destitute as he was, the Ruler of Laṅkā. Storehouse of virtue and wisdom and beyond all measure, You have no pride in You and are unborn, all pervading and free from the taint of Māyā; I constantly adore You, Rāma. Terrible is the glory and might of Your arms, which are deft in exterminating the hordes of the impious. Compassionate and friendly to the poor without any ostensible reason and a reservoir of beauty, I adore You alongwith Rāma (Sītā). Deliverer from the rounds of birth and death, You are beyond both cause (Prakṛti) and effect (the phenomenal universe) and eradicate the awful weaknesses of the (devotee's) mind. Armed with a charming bow, arrows, and quiver, You have eyes resembling a red lotus. A paragon of kings, home of bliss, Lakṣmī's lovely Consort, subduer of arrogance, lust and the false sense of mineness, You are free from blemish integral and imperceptible to the senses. Though manifest in all forms, You never transmuted Yourself into them all: so declare the Vedas; it is no mere gossip, as will be clear from the analogy of the sun and the sunshine, which are different and yet identical. Blessed are all these monkeys, O ubiquitous Lord, who reverently gaze on Your countenance; while accursed, O Hari, is our (so-called) immortal existence and our ethereal bodies in that we lack in devotion to You and are lost in worldly pleasures. Now show Your mercy to me, compassionate as You are to the afflicted, and take away my differentiating sense (which makes the world appear as apart from You), which leads me to wrong action and deluded by which I pass my days in merriment, mistaking woe for happiness. Destroyer of the wicked and lovely jewel of the earth, Your lotus feet are adored even by Śambhu (Lord Śiva) and Umā (Goddess Pārvatī). O King of kings, grant me this boon that I may cherish loving devotion to Your lotus feet, which is a perennial source of blessings.\""

The Lord of the Raghus understood that His father bore the same affection for Him as he did before; He, therefore, looked at His father and bestowed on him solid wisdom. Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) Daśaratha did not attain final beatitude for this simple reason that he set his heart on Devotion while maintaining his separate identity. Worshippers of God in His embodied form spurn final beatitude: to them Śrī Rāma vouchsafes devotion to His own person.

Glory to the Slayer of Dμusana and Khara and the crusher of the demon hordes! Now that You have disposed of this wretch, my lord, all the gods enjoy full security. Glory to the Reliever of Earth's burden, whose greatness is beneficent and unbounded. Glory to the All-merciful Slayer of Rāvaṇa, who reduced the demon host to a miserable plight. Outrageous was the pride of Rāvaṇa (the lord of Laṅkā), who had subdued even gods and Gandharvas (the celestial musicians). Nay, he relentlessly pursued sages, the Siddhas, human beings, birds and Nāgas alike. He took delight in injuring others and was most wicked; the vile sinner has now reaped the fruit of his misdeeds. Now listen, my lord, possessed of eyes as large as the lotus and compassionate to the humble: my pride was inordinate; I accounted no one as equal to me. At the sight of Your lotus feet, however, my pride, which entailed much woe, has taken leave of me. Some people meditate on the attributeless Brahma (the Absolute), whom the Vedas declare as unmanifest. What attracts my mind, however, is the Supreme embodied as Śrī Rāma, King of Kosala. Together with Videha's Daughter and Your younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa), therefore, pray abide in my heart; and recognizing me as Your own servant, bless me with devotion, O Abode of Rāma (Lakṣmī)."

The Lord Himself can wipe out the inhabitants of the three spheres and bring them back to life; He wished only to give Indra honour. By a shower of nectar the latter restored the monkeys and bears to life. They all arose with delight and betook themselves to the Lord. Although the shower of nectar promiscuously fell on the dead of both the armies, it is the bears and monkeys alone that returned to life, but not the demons. Their mind was absorbed in the thought of Śrī Rāma when they gave up the ghost; that is why they got liberated and were rid of the bonds of mundane existence. As for the monkeys and bears, they were all part manifestations of the gods (who are all immortal): hence they all came to life by the will of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). Is there anyone so kind to the afflicted as Śrī Rāma, who liberated the whole demon host? Even the wicked Rāvaṇa, who was a sink of impurities and given up to sensuality, attained to an exalted state which is withheld even from the greatest of sages."

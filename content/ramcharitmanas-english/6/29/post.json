They uttered horrible cries of \"Seize and kill !\", which echoed all round. With their mouths wide open they rushed to devour the monkeys, who then took to their heels. But whithersoever they turned in their flight they saw a blazing fire. The monkeys and bears were thus in a quandary. Then Ravana began raining on them a shower of sand. Having thus flabbergasted the monkeys on all sides, the ten- headed monster roared again. All the heroes, including Laksmana and Sugriva (the king of the monkeys), fainted. The bravest of them wrung their hands, crying \"Ah, Rama ! Alas, Raghunatha (Lord of the Raghus)!\" Having thus crushed the might of all, he wrought another delusion. He manifested a host of Hanumans, who rushed forward with rocks in their hands and encircled Sri Rama in a dense cordon on every side. With uplifted tails and gnashing their teeth they shouted, \"Seize and kill him; let him not escape!\" Surrounded by their tails on every side, the Lord of Kosala shone in their midst. (1-8)"

The delusion having vanished, the monkeys and bears rejoiced and all turned back with trees and rocks in their hands. Sri Rama shot forth a volley of arrows, which once more cut off Ravana's arms and heads to the ground. If hundreds of Sesas (serpent-gods), Saradas (goddesses of speech), the Vedas and bards were to recite the story of the battle between Sri Rama and Ravana and that too for many cycles together, even they would never be able to do justice to it.

Many ill-omens manifested themselves at that time. Donkeys, jackals and dogs howled in large numbers. Birds too screamed, and thereby portended a world calamity: and comets appeared in every quarter of the heavens. There was a preternatural and unusual glow in the horizon on all sides and a solar eclipse occurred even without the day of the new moon (when the sun and the moon are in conjunction). Mandodari's heart beat wildly and idols shed tears from their eyes. (1-5)"

            "One arrow sucked up the depths of the navel, while the rest struck his ten heads and twenty arms with impetuosity. The arrows carried off with them all his heads and arms, while the headless and armless trunk danced on the battle-field. The earth sunk under the weight of the trunk as it rushed violently on, till the Lord struck it with His arrow and split it in two. While dying he shouted with a loud and terrible roar: \"Where is Rama, that I may challenge and slay him in battle?\" The earth reeled as the ten- headed monster fell; the ocean, the rivers, the elephants guarding the quarters, and the mountains were shaken. Expanding the two halves he dropped to the ground, crushing under their weight a host of bears and monkeys. After depositing the arms and heads before Mandodari, the darts returned to the Lord of the universe and all found their way back into the quiver. Seeing this, the gods sounded their kettle-drums. His soul entered the Lord's mouth in the form of effulgence. Lord Sambhu and the four-faced Brahma (the Creator) rejoiced to see the spectacle. The whole universe resounded with cries of \"Victory ! Victory !! Glory to the Hero of Raghu's line, mighty of arm !!!\" Gods and sages rained down flowers, shouting \"Glory, glory to the All-merciful ! Glory to Mukunda (the Bestower of liberation) !!\""

On the battle-field Sri Rama's limbs displayed the beauty of a number of Cupids. The crown of matted hair on His head, interspersed with most beautiful flowers, gleamed like flashes of lightning on the star-lit peak of a dark mountain. As He stood turning His bow and arrow between His arms, specks of blood adorned His person, like a swarm of Raimuni* birds perched on a Tamala tree absorbed in their delight."

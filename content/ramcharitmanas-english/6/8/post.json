As soon as he entered the city he met one of Rāvaṇa's sons (Prahasta by name), who was playing there. From words they proceeded to fight; for both were unrivalled in strength and in the prime of youth to boot. He raised his foot to kick Aṅgada, who in his turn seized the foot and, swinging him round, dashed him to the ground finding him a formidable warrior, the demons ran helterskelter in large numbers, too much frightened to raise an alarm. They did not tell one another what had happened, but kept quiet when they thought of the death of Rāvaṇa's son. There was a cry in the whole city that the same monkey who had burnt down Laṅkā had come again. \"Who knows what turn Providence is going to take?\" everyone thought in excessive dismay. People showed him the way unasked: if he but looked at anyone, the latter would turn deadly pale."

You have been born as a fire in a cluster of bamboos for the destruction of your own race. Why should you have not perished even in the womb? In vain were you born, who have called yourself with your own mouth a hermit's envoy. Now tell me if all is well with Vāli and, if so, where is he?\" Aṅgada laughed at this and then replied. \"Ten days hence you shall go to Vāli and embracing your friend personally enquire after his welfare. He will tell you all about the welfare that follows from hostility with Śrī Rāma. Listen, O fool: the seeds of dissension can be sown in the mind of him alone whose heart is closed to the Hero of Raghu's line.\""

Remembering such amiability of your disposition I have been so insolent in my behaviour with you, O Rāvaṇa. On coming here I have witnessed all that Hanumān told me, viz., that you have no shame, no anger and no feeling of resentment.\" \"It is because you possess such a mentality that you have proved to be the death of your own father.\" Uttering these words Rāvaṇa burst into a laughter. \"Having been the death of my father I would have next claimed you as my victim; but a thought has come to me just now. Knowing you to be a living memorial of Vāli's unsullied fame, I desist from killing you, O vile boaster. Tell me, Rāvaṇa, how many Ravanas there are in the world? Or hear from me how many I have heard of. One went to the nether world (Pātāla) to conquer Bali and was tied up in the stables by the children, who made sport of him and thrashed him till Bali took compassion on him and had him released. Another again was discovered by King Sahasrabāhu, who ran and captured him as a strange creature and brought him home for the sake of fun. The sage Pulastya then went and secured his release.\""

            "\"When as my skulls began to burn I saw the decree of Providence traced on my brow and read that I was going to die at the hands of a mortal, I laughed; for I knew Brahmā's prophecy to be false. I am not afraid in my heart even when I remember this; for (I am sure) Brahma must have traced the decree in his senile dementia. Yet, you fool, you repeatedly exalt the might of another hero in my presence, giving up all shame and decorum.\" Aṅgada replied: \"Yes, there is no one in the whole world so shamefaced as you. You are bashful by your innate disposition, since you never indulge in self-praise. Only the story of offering your heads (to Lord Śiva) and lifting the mountain (Kailāsa) has been foremost in your mind and hence you have told it twenty times over. As for (the tale of) that strength of arm by which you were able to conquer Sahasrabāhu, Bali and Vāli, you have kept it secret in your heart. Listen, fool, and brag no more. Can anyone turn a hero by cutting off one's head ? A juggler is never called a hero even though he hacks to pieces his whole body with his own hands.\""

Yet his most beautiful crowns fell to the ground; some of them he took and set on his heads, while Aṅgada sent the rest flying to the Lord. The monkeys fled when they saw the crowns coming. \"Good heavens, how is it that meteors have begun to fall even during the daytime ? Or is it that Rāvaṇa in his fury has hurled four thunderbolts, which are coming with great speed ?\" The Lord smiled and said, \"Be not afraid at heart. They are neither meteors nor thunderbolts, nor even the planets Rāhu and Ketu. They are the crowns of the ten-headed Rāvaṇa, despatched by Vāli's son (Aṅgada), that are coming this side.\""

Otherwise I feel so enraged that I would break all your ten heads and lifting up Laṅkā drop it into the ocean. Your Laṅkā is like a fruit of the Udumbara tree; while you are like so many unsuspecting insects that reside in it. A monkey as I am, I would lose no time in eating it; but the gracious Rāma has not given me the order.\" Rāvaṇa smiled to hear this witty remark. \"Fool, where did you learn to tell such big lies? Vāli never boasted like this; it seems association with the hermits has made you such a vaunting liar.\" \"I am a blustering liar indeed, O monster with twenty arms, if I do not tear out your ten tongues.\" Recalling Śrī Rāma's might Aṅgada grew indignant and firmly planted his foot in the midst of the whole assembly. \"If you can but stir my foot, O fool Śrī Rāma will return forthwith and I shall forgo Sītā as a lost wager.\" \"Listen, champions all:\" exclaimed the ten-headed monster, \"seize the monkey by the leg and dash him to the ground.\" Meghanāda (the vanquisher of Indra) and many other stout warriors rose with delight from their respective seats and rushed with all their might, employing numerous devices; but Aṅgada's foot refused to stir. The competitors, therefore, resumed their seats with their heads bent low. The enemies of heaven rose again and dashed forward; but the monkey's foot moved no more than a sensually-minded striver, O Garuḍa (the enemy of serpents), is able to uproot the tree of error implanted in his heart (continues Kākabhuśuṇḍi)."

            "Everyone who saw the monkey's strength was discomfited at heart. Challenged by the monkey Rāvaṇa himself now rose. Even as Rāvaṇa proceeded to grasp his foot, Vāli's son (Aṅgada) broke out, \"You cannot be saved by clinging to my feet. Fool, why do you not go and clasp Śrī Rāma's feet ?\" He turned back much abashed at heart to hear this. All his splendour was gone and he was robbed of his glory even as the moon fades away at midday. With drooping heads he resumed his seat on the throne as if despoiled of all his riches. Śrī Rāma is the soul of the universe and the lord of life : how can he who is hostile to Him find any rest ? The universe, Umā (Pārvatī), springs into existence and is again dissolved with a mere play of Śrī Rāma's eyebrows. When He is capable of transforming a blade of grass into a thunderbolt and a thunderbolt into a blade of grass, how, then, can a vow of His ambassador prove false ? Aṅgada admonished him in various ways; but as his end had drawn near, he would not listen. Having squashed the enemy's pride, the son of King Vāli glorified his lord to his very face and departed, saying : \"If I do not slay you after I have sported with you on the battlefield for some time, it will be no use my indulging in self-praise just now.\" Aṅgada had killed Rāvaṇa's son even before he arrived in the latter's presence and Rāvaṇa felt very sad at the news. The demons too grew particularly nervous with fear when they witnessed the effectiveness of Aṅgada's challenge."

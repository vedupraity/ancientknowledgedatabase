Said the monkey: \"First receive, holy sir, your fee as my spiritual preceptor and after that impart to me the sacred formula.\" Hanuman then twisted his tail round the hermit's head and knocked him down, and he appeared in his natural (demoniac) form at the moment of his death and gave up the ghost while muttering \"Rama, Rama.\" Hanuman was delighted at heart to hear this name and proceeded on his journey. He found the mountain but failed to single out the herb (prescribed by Susena); he, therefore, lost no time in uprooting the mount itself. Holding up the mountain in his hand, Hanuman darted back through the air while it was yet night and happened to pass over the city of Ayodhya."

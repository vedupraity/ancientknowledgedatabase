When the lance struck Him, the Lord fainted for a while. Although it was a mere sport on the part of the Lord, the gods were filled with dismay. When Vibhisana saw that the Lord had been grievously hurt, he seized his club and rushed forward full of rage. \"You wretched vile and perverse fool ! You have antagonized gods, human beings, sages and Nagas alike. You devoutly offered your heads to Lord Siva and have got millions for one in return. It is for this reason, O wretch, that you have been spared till this time; your death, however, seems to be impending now. Fool, you seek happiness through enmity with Sri Rama?\" So saying, Vibhisana struck his brother right on the chest with his club."

            "The moment Mandodari (Ravana's principal spouse) saw her lord's heads she fainted in her grief and dropped to the ground. His other wives too sprang up and rushed to the spot weeping; lifting up and supporting Mandodari they all arrived where Ravana's remains lay. Seeing their lord's condition they set up a shriek; their hair flew loose and they became oblivious of their body. Wildly beating their bosom and weeping, they recounted his glory. \"At your might, my Lord, the earth ever shook; fire, the moon and the sun stood obscure before your splendour. Even Sesa (the serpent-god) and the divine Tortoise could not bear the weight of your body, which is now lying on the ground soiled with dust. Varuna (the god presiding over the waters), Kubera (the god of riches), Indra (the lord of the celestials) and the wind-god-none of these ever had the courage to confront you in battle. By the might of your arm, my lord, you conquered Death as well as Yama (the god who punishes evil-doers in the other world); yet you lie today like a forlorn creature. Your greatness is known all the world over; even your sons and kinsmen possessed untold strength. Hostility with Rama has, however, reduced you to such a plight : not one of your stock is left to lament over your death. The whole of God's creation, my lord, was under your control; the frightened regents of the eight quarters ever bowed their heads to you. But now jackals feast on your heads and arms, a fate in no way undeserved by an enemy of Sri Rama. Doomed to death, my lord, you heeded not my words, and took the Ruler of all animate and inanimate beings for an ordinary mortal."

Seeing all the women making lamentation Vibhisana approached them with a very heavy heart and was grieved to see his Brother's condition. The Lord thereupon gave an order to His younger brother, Laksmana, who consoled him in many ways. Then Vibhisana returned to his lord, who looked upon him with an eye of compassion and said, \"Abandon all sorrow and perform the funeral rites.\" In obedience to the Lord's command he celebrated the obsequies, strictly observing the scriptural ordinance and with due regard to time and place."

An uproarious noise burst forth as the car took off, all shouting \"Glory to the Hero of Raghu's line !\" The car was provided with a lofty and charming throne; the Lord took His seat on it alongwith Śrī (Sītā). Accompanied by His Spouse, Śrī Rāma shone forth like a cloud with lightning on a peak of Mount Meru. The splendid car moved with all speed on its way, to the joy of the gods, who rained down flowers on it. A most delightful cool breeze breathed soft and fragrant; the water of the ocean, lakes and streams became transparent and auspicious omens occurred on all sides. Nay, everyone felt cheerful at heart; the whole expanse of the sky including the four quarters was clear. Said the Hero of Raghu's line: \"Mark, Sītā: it was on this spot that lakṣmaṇa slew Meghanada (the Crown Prince of Laṇkā). Here lie on the battlefield mighty demons killed by Hanumān and Aṅgada. And here fell the two brothers, Kumbhakarṇa and Rāvaṇa, the torment of gods and sages.\""

Now have a look at Prayāga, the king of all sacred places, whose very sight drives away sins committed through a myriad lives. Again look at the most holy Triveṇī (the confluence of the Gaṅgā, Yamunā and the subterranean Sarasvatī), the dispeller of grief and a ladder to Śrī Hari's Abode.

At this end the Nisada chief heard that the Lord had come and exclaiming \"The boat, where is the boat ?\" summoned his people. Meanwhile the aerial car flew across the celestial stream and landed on the bank (adjoining Srngaverapura) in obedience to the Lord's command. Then Sītā offered all kinds of worship to the celestial stream and threw Herself at the feet of the Goddess presiding over the stream. In gladness of soul Gaṅgā pronounced Her blessing. \"May You enjoy a happy married life without a break, O fair lady.\" Overwhelmed with love, Guha ran to meet the Lord as soon as he heard of His landing and approached his Master, full of ecstatic joy. Perceiving the Lord accompanied by Videha's Daughter, he fell flat on the ground oblivious of his own existence. The Lord of the Raghus felt overjoyed to see his excessive fondness; He took and clasped him to His bosom."

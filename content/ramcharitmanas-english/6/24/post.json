It was a heavenly and unique car, which was all splendour; the King of Kosalapura (Ayodhyā) gladly mounted it. It was driven by four high-spirited and charming horses, which knew no decay or death and flew as fast as thought. The monkeys rushed forward with renewed vigour when they saw the Lord of the Raghus mounted on a chariot. When Rāvaṇa felt that the monkey's onset was irresistible, he took to creating illusions. The illusive creation did not touch the Lord of the Raghus; while the monkeys, nay, even Lakṣmaṇa took it for real. The monkeys saw among a large demon host a number of Ramas and as many Lakṣmaṇa."

My name is Rāvaṇa, whose glory is known all the world over, and whose prison holds within its walls the regents of the spheres! You slew Khara, Dμusana and Virādha and killed poor Vali even as a hunter would shoot his game. Nay, you wiped out a host of demon champions and killed even Kumbhakarṇa and Meghanāda. Today I will, wreak vengeance on you for all this unless, O prince, you flee away from the battle. Today I will surely give you over to death; for it is the relentless Rāvaṇa whom you have to deal with.\" Hearing his foul talk the All-merciful took him as doomed to death and smilingly replied as follows: \"True, true is all your greatness.

            "The arrows flew like winged serpents. At the first onset they killed Rāvaṇa's charioteer and horses; then, smashing the car, they tore off his ensign and flags. Even though his strength had inwardly failed him, he roared aloud and, immediately mounting another car, ground his teeth and hurled missiles and other weapons of every description. All his efforts, however, failed like those of a man whose mind is ever intent on harming others. Then Rāvaṇa hurled forth ten pikes, which struck the four horses of Śrī Rāma's chariot and overthrew them. The Lord raised His horses and, drawing the bow string, let fly His darts in great fury. The arrows of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line) sped forth like a string of bees* to enter Rāvaṇa's heads, which compared a bed of lotuses. Śrī Rāma struck each of his brows with ten arrows, which pierced through them; and blood gushed forth in torrents. Though bleeding profusely, the mighty demon rushed forward; the Lord once more fitted arrows to His bow. The Hero of Raghu's line discharged thirty shafts, which shot down his heads and arms to the ground. But they grew afresh as soon as they were severed; Śrī Rāma, however, struck off his heads and arms once more. Time after time the Lord smote off his arms and heads; but they were renewed as soon as they were blown off. Again and again the Lord tore off his arms and heads; for the King of Kosala takes delight in playing. The sky was full of heads and arms like an infinite number of Ketus and Rahus."

Flying into a rage on the battle- field, the ten-headed monster discharged a shower of arrows and screened with it the chariot of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), which was lost to sight for nearly half an hour, even as the sun is obscured by mist. When the gods raised a piteous cry, the Lord took up His bow, full of wrath. Intercepting the enemy's arrows He struck off his heads, which covered all the quarters as well as the intermediate points of the compass, as well as heaven and earth. The severed heads flew through the air and struck terror into the monkeys' hearts as they uttered the cries of \"Victory, Victory!! Where is Lakṣmaṇa? Where is Sugrīva, the lord of the monkeys? Where is the hero of Raghu's line, the lord of Kosala?\""

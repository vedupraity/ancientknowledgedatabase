            "Uma, there is no such friend as Sri Rama in this world-neither preceptor, nor father, nor mother, nor brother, nor master. Gods, men and sages, all as a rule have some selfish motive behind their love. The same Sugriva who trembled day and night in fear of Vali, who had many a sore on his body and whose breast ever burnt with the fire of anxiety, was made the king of monkeys! The Hero of Raghu's line is extremely compassionate by nature. No wonder that men who knowingly abandon such a lord should be caught in the meshes of calamity. The Lord then sent for Sugriva and instructed him in the various principles of statecraft. Said the Lord, \"Listen, O Sugriva, lord of the monkeys: I may not enter a town for four years and ten. The hot season is now over and the rains have set in. I will, therefore, encamp on the hills not far from you. You and Angada rule over the kingdom, and ever cherish my business in your heart.\" When Sugriva returned home, Sri Rama took up His abode on the Pravarsana hills."

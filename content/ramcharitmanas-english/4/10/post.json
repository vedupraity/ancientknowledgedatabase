He would have finished me immediately my father was killed, had not Sri Rama protected me; hence I owe no gratitude to him.\" Again and again Angada told them all, \"Our death has arrived: there is no doubt about it.\" When the monkey chiefs heard Angada's words, they could make no answer and tears rolled from their eyes. For a moment they remained plunged in sorrow; but at last they spoke as follows: \"We are not going to return without obtaining Sita's news, O sagacious prince!\" So saying all the monkeys went to the sea-shore and spreading Kusa grass there squatted on it. Seeing Angada's distress Jambavan (the old bear chief) gave a highly instructive discourse. \"Imagine not Rama to be a mortal, dear child; know Him to be the same as Brahma (the Supreme Spirit) without attributes, invincible and unborn. We, His servants, are all highly blessed in that we are ever devoted to the same Brahma endowed with a qualified form."

I have been starving for many days past and have never had a full meal; today God has supplied me with abundant food all at a time.\" The monkeys trembled with fear to hear the vulture's words. \"Our doom is now sealed, we are sure,\" they said to themselves. All the monkeys rose when they saw the vulture; while Jambavan felt much perturbed at heart. Angada reflected within himself and said: \"There is no one so blessed as Jatayu, who laid down his life in the service of Sri Rama and ascended to the abode of Sri Hari, supremely lucky as he was.\" When the bird (Sampati) heard these words, which stirred in him a mixed feeling of joy and grief, he drew near to the monkeys, who felt alarmed by his presence. Assuring them of safety he went and enquired them about his younger brother and the monkeys told him the whole story. When Sampati heard of his brother's obsequies (performed by the Lord with His own hands), he glorified the Lord of Raghus in many ways."

Jatayu could not bear the heat of the sun and came back; but I in my pride advanced nearer the sun. My wings were scorched with the inordinate heat and I fell to the ground with a fearful scream. A sage, Candrama by name, (who lived there) was moved with compassion when he saw me. He taught me spiritual wisdom in many ways and rid me of my identification with the body. 'In the Treta age the Supreme Spirit will take the form of a human being and the demon king (Ravana) will carry off His Spouse. The Lord will send out spies to search Her and you will be absolved of all sins by meeting them. Your wings will sprout again; worry not any longer on that account. You will have to do only this much: show them where Sita may be.' The sage's predictions has come true today; therefore, follow my instructions and set about the business of your Lord. On the summit of the Trikuta hill stands the city of Lanka; Ravana, who is fearless by nature, lives there. There, in the Asoka garden, is lodged Sita, who sits there, plunged in grief, even now."

Even sinners who invoke Śrī Rāma's Name are able to cross the vast and boundless ocean of mundane existence. You, therefore, who are His spies, should never lose nerve but be up and doing with the image of Śrī Rāma enshrined in your heart.\" So saying, O Garuḍa! Continues Kākabhuśuṇḍi the vulture departed, leaving them much amazed at heart. Now each one of the monkeys talked of his own strength, but doubted his ability to leap across. Said Jāmbavān (the king of bears), \"I am now too old and not a particle of my former strength is left in my body. When Śrī Rāma, the Slayer of the demon Khara, assumed the form of Trivikrama (the Lord with three strides, Lord Vamana), I was young and possessed great strength."

A son of the wind-god, you are as strong as your father and are a storehouse of intelligence, discretion and spiritual wisdom. What undertaking in this world is too difficult for you to accomplish, dear child? It is for the service of Śrī Rāma that you have come down upon earth.\" The moment Hanumān heard these words he grew to the size of a mountain, with a body shining as gold and full of splendour as though he was another king of mountains (Sumeru). Roaring again and again like a lion he said, \"I can easily spring across the salt ocean and killing Rāvaṇa with all his army can uproot the Trikūṭa hill and bring it here. But I ask you, Jāmbavān kindly tender me suitable advice.\" \"All that you have to do, my son, is to go and see Sītā and come back with Her tidings. Then the lotus-eyed Śrī Rāma will recover Her by the strength of His arm taking with Him a host of monkeys for mere sport."

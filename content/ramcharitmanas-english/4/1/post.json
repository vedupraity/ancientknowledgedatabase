(1) Blessed are those pious souls who ceaselessly quaff the nectar of Śrī Rāma's Name, churned out of the ocean of the Vedas, which completely destroys the sins of the Kali age and knows no decay, which shines ever bright in the most beautiful moon-like mouth of the glorious Śambhu (Lord Śiva), a palatable remedy for the disease of transmigration and the very life of Sītā (Janaka's Daughter)."

Who else is so merciful as Lord Śaṅkara?"

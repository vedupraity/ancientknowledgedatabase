(1) Blessed are those pious souls who ceaselessly quaff the nectar of Sri Rama's Name, churned out of the ocean of the Vedas, which completely destroys the sins of the Kali age and knows no decay, which shines ever bright in the most beautiful moon-like mouth of the glorious Sambhu (Lord Siva), a palatable remedy for the disease of transmigration and the very life of Sita (Janaka's Daughter)."

Who else is so merciful as Lord Sankara?"

            "I unceasingly extol Śrī Rāma, the praiseworthy lord of Sītā (Janaka's Daughter), the chief of Raghu's line, possessed of a form greenish blue as the neck of a peacock and adorned with a print of the Brāhmaṇa's lotus-foot-which testifies to His being the greatest of all gods-rich in splendour, clad in yellow robes, lotus-eyed, ever-propitious, holding a bow and arrow in His hands, mounted on the aerial car named Puṣpaka, accompanied by a host of monkeys and waited upon by His own brother (Lakṣmaṇa). The lotus-feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of Kosala), charming and delicate, are adored by Brahmā (the Unborn) and the greatest Lord Śiva and fondled by the lotus hands of Janaka's Daughter and are the haunt of the bee-like mind of the worshipper. (2) I glorify the All-merciful Lord Śaṅkara, possessing a comely form, white as the jasmine flower, the moon and the conch, with eyes resembling a lovely lotus, Ambika's (Mother Pārvatī's) Spouse, the bestower of one's desired fruit and the deliverer from the clutches of carnality."

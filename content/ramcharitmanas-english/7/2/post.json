But the Lord never takes into account the faults of His devotees, being a friend of the humble and most tender-hearted. I have a firm conviction in my heart that Śrī Rāma will surely meet me; for the omens are so propitious.

Having conquered His foe in battle, with the gods to hymn His praises, the Lord is now on His way with Sītā and lakṣmaṇa.\" The moment Bharata heard these words he forgot all his woes, like a thirsty man who has secured nectar. \"Who are you, my beloved friend, and whence have you come? You have told me a most pleasing news.\" \" Listen, O fountain of mercy: I am the son of the wind-god, a monkey; Hanumān is my name. I am a humble servant of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), the befriender of the meek.\" Hearing this, Bharata rose and reverently embraced him. The affection with which he embraced him was too great for his heart to contain; his eyes streamed with tears and every hair on his body stood erect. \"At your very sight, O Hanumān, all my woes have disappeared. In you I have embraced today my beloved Rāma Himself.\" Again and again he enquired after Śrī Rāma's health and said, \"Listen, brother; what shall I give you (in return for this happy news)? I have pondered and found that there is nothing in this world to match the news you have brought. I am thus unable to repay my debt to you. Now, pray, recount to me the doings of my lord.\" Then Hanumān bowed his head at Bharata's feet and narrated all the meritorious deeds of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). \"Tell me, Hanumān, does my gracious lord ever remember me as one of His servants?\" (1-8)"

            "Accompanied by his preceptor (the sage Vasistha) and kinsmen, his younger brother (Śatrughna) and a host of Brāhmaṇas, with a heart overflowing with affection, Bharata joyfully set forth to receive the All-merciful. Many women, who had climbed up their attics, looked above for the aerial car in the sky. And the moment they espied it they began in their joy to sing festal songs in melodious strains. Just as the sight of the full moon brings joy to the ocean and swells it, the city of Ayodhyā too joyfully rushed with a tumultuous noise to meet the Lord of the Raghus, the women of the city moving to and fro like so many waves."

Although all have extolled Vaikuntha (My divine Abode), which is familiar to the Vedas and the Purāṇas and known throughout the world, it is not so dear to Me as the city of Ayodhyā: only some rare soul knows this secret. This beautiful city is My birthplace; to the north of it flows the holy Sarayũ, by bathing in which men secure a home near Me without any difficulty. The dwellers here are very dear to Me; the city is not only full of bliss itself but bestows a residence in My divine Abode.\" The monkeys were all delighted to hear these words of the Lord and said, \"Blessed indeed is Ayodhyā, that has evoked praise from Śrī Rāma Himself !\""

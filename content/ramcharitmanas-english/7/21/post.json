Girijā (Daughter of the mountain-king) was greatly delighted at heart to hear the whole narrative and replied in pleasing tones : \"By the grace of my lord (Yourself) my doubts have disappeared and my devotion to Śrī Rāma's feet has been renovated.\""

By the grace of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) Himself I have sung to the best of my ability this sacred and charming story. In this age of Kali no other discipline is of any avail-neither Yoga (mind-control) nor sacrifices, nor Japa (muttering of prayers) not austere penance nor any sacred vows nor ritual : Rāma alone should be remembered, Rāma alone should be glorified; and it is the catalogue of Rāma's virtues alone that should be given ear to. Forswearing perversity, my soul, adore Him whose great vow it is to sanctify the fallen, as is declared by seers and saints, the Vedas and Purāṇas : who has not secured redemption by worshipping Śrī Rāma?"

Men who repeat to others, listen to (when repeated by others) or chant alone this narrative of Śrī Rāma (the Ornament of Raghu's race) thereby wipe out the sins that are incident to the Kali age as well as the impurities of their soul, and ascend to the Abode of Śrī Rāma without any difficulty. Nay the Chief of the Raghus cures the perversities, caused by the fivefold* ignorance, of those men who treasure up in their heart even a few Caupāis (small four-footed verses) of this narrative that appeal to them as most charming.

            "The same mysterious \"Mānasa-Rāmāyaṇa\" (the story of Śrī Rāma figuratively spoken of as a Mānasa lake) which was composed of yore by the blessed Lord Śambhu, the best of all poets, with the object of developing unceasing devotion to the lotus-feet of the all-beautiful Śrī Rāma, has been likewise rendered into the vulgar tongue by Tulasīdāsa for dispersing the gloom of his heart, cognizing the fact that it is devoted to the Name of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). This glorious, holy, purifying, blessed and most limpid Mānasa lake of Śrī Rāma's exploits ever begets happiness; nay, it bestows both wisdom and Devotion, wipes out delusion, infatuation and impurity and is brimful with the water of love. Men who devoutly take a plunge into it are never scorched with the burning rays of the sun of worldly illusion."

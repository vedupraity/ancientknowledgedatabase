Vasiṣṭha (the chief of the sages) embraced them (in return) and enquired after their welfare. Śrī Rāma replied, \"It is in your grace alone that our welfare lies.\" The Lord of Raghu's race, the champion of righteousness, now met all the other Brāhmaṇas and bowed His head to them. Then Bharata clasped the Lord's lotus-feet, which are adored by gods and sages, Śaṅkara and Brahma not excepted. He lay prostrate on the ground and would not rise even though being lifted up, till at last the All-merciful forcibly took and pressed him to His bosom. Every hair on His swarthy form stood erect and His lotus eyes were flooded with tears."

With great reverence and love all applauded Bharata's affection, amiability, austerities and discipline. When they saw the citizens' mode of life, they all extolled their devotion to the Lord's feet. Then the Lord of the Raghus summoned all His comrades and exhorted them: \"Clasp the feet of My Guru, the sage Vasiṣṭha, who is worthy of adoration to our whole race. It was by his grace that all the demons were slain in battle.\" \"(Turning to the sage) Listen, holy Sir : all these My comrades proved as so many barks in taking Me across the ocean of the battle. They staked their life in My cause: they are dearer to Me even than Bharata.\" They were all enraptured to hear the Lord's word; every moment that passed gave birth to some new joy."

Every kind of festive preparation was taken in hand; the city was en fete and a large number of kettledrums sounded all at once. Ladies scattered their offerings about the Lord wherever He went, and invoked blessing on Him with their hearts full of joy. Bevies of young women sang festal songs, while gold plates provided with lights were ready at hand, which they waved about the Lord, who is the Reliever of all agony and brought delight to Raghu's race even as the sun delights a bed of lotuses. The splendour, the wealth and the good fortune of the city have been extolled by the Vedas, Śeṣa (the serpent-god) and Śāradā (the goddess of speech and learning). But they too were dazed to see this spectacle. Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) how, then, can any mortal recount His virtues?"

Delay no more, O good sage, but apply the sacred mark on the forehead of His Majesty as a token of sovereignty.\""

He took His meals with His younger brothers and the sight filled all the mothers with joy. The two brothers, Bharata and Śatrughna, would accompany the son of the wind-god to some grove, where they would sit and ask Hanumān to expatiate on Śrī Rāma's virtues, and Hanumān would plunge his sound intellect into the ocean of His virtues and then recount them. The two brothers derived much joy from the discourse on His immaculate virtues and with much entreaty had it repeated again and again. Everywhere-in every house the people recited the Purāṇas and narrated Śrī Rāma's holy exploits of a diverse character. Men and women alike joined in hymning Śrī Rāma's praises and days and nights passed on unnoticed."

A most beautiful boundary wall with its battlements painted in different colours enclosed the city on all sides, as though the nine planets had mustered a large army and besieged Amarāvatī (Indra's capital). The ground (the streets and squares etc.,) was so beautifully paved with crystals of various colours that the mind of the greatest Sages would be enraptured at the sight. The white palaces were so high as to reach the skies; their shining pinnacles put to shame as it were the effulgence of the sun and the moon. Latticed windows made of diverse precious stones shone here and there; while every house was lit up with jewels that served as lamps."

There were numerous most charming Ghāṭas for women to take water from, where men did not bathe. The best of all and beautiful in everyway was the royal Ghata, where men of all the four castes could bathe. All along the bank stood temples sacred to the gods and surrounded by lovely groves. Here and there on the river bank dwelt sages and recluses unconcerned with the world and devoted to spiritual wisdom. All along the bank stood in clusters many a lovely Tulasī plant reared by hermits. The splendour of the city defied all description; its outskirts too were most picturesque. The very sight of the city with its groves and gardens, wells and ponds, drove away all one's sins."

To begin with, the night of ignorance terminated; the owl-like sins hid themselves wherever they could; the white lily in the shape of lust and anger closed. Cakora birds in the shape of activities of various kinds, the phenomenal existence, Time and Nature never rejoiced; thieves like jealousy, pride, infatuation and arrogance had no occasion to display their skill in any quarter; lotuses of every description in the shape of knowledge and realization opened in the pond of piety. Happiness, contentment, dispassion and discernment, like so many Cakravāka birds, were rid of sorrow."

Finding it a good opportunity the sage Sanaka* and his three brothers (Sanandana, Sanātana and Sanatkumāra) arrived there. They were all embodiments of spiritual glow, adorned with amiability and other noble qualities and constantly absorbed in the ecstasy of union with Brahma; though infants to all appearance, they are aeons old. The sages looked upon all with the same eye and were above all diversity; it seemed as if the four Vedas had each assumed a bodily form. They had no covering on their body except the quarters; and their only hobby was to hear the recital of Śrī Rāma's exploits wherever it was carried on. Sanaka and his brothers, O Bhavānī, (continues Lord Śiva,) had stayed in the hermitage of the enlightened sage Agastya and the noble sage had narrated to them many a story relating to Śrī Rāma, which are productive of wisdom in the same way as the friction of two pieces of wood produces fire."

            "All His three brothers (Bharata, Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna) then prostrated themselves alongwith Hanumān and everyone felt very happy. The sages were beside themselves with rapture on beholding the incomparable beauty of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). They remained gazing with unwinking eyes on the Lord, who is the abode of comeliness and brings about release from worldly existence and has a swarthy form and lotus-eyes . The Lord in His turn bowed His head with joined palms. When the Hero of Raghu's line perceived their condition, His eyes too streamed with tears and every hair on His body stood on its end. Taking them by the hand, the Lord seated them and addressed them in most charming words : \"Listen, great sages: I am indeed blessed today. By your very sight all one's sins are wiped out. By extreme good luck one is able to secure the company of saints; for through such communion the chain of births and deaths is broken without the least exertion."

A storehouse of wisdom that You are, You are free from pride and yet bestow honour on others : the Vedas and Purana's sing Your sanctifying glory. Knower of Truth, You acknowledge the services of Your devotees and destroy their ignorance. Untainted by Māyā, You bear numberless names and are yet beyond all. You are manifest as all, pervade all and dwell in the heart of all; therefore, protect us every moment. Break asunder the bonds in the form of pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.,) adversity and mundane existence; and abiding in our heart, O Rāma, eradicate our sensuality and vanity."

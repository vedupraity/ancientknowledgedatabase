All men loved one another : each followed one's prescribed duty, conformably to the precepts of the Vedas. Dharma with its four pillars (viz., truth, purity-both external and internal, compassion and charity) reigned everywhere throughout the world; no one even dreamt of sin. Men and women alike were devoted to Śrī Rāma's worship and all were qualified for final beatitude. There was no premature death nor suffering of any kind; everyone was comely and sound of body. No one was destitute, afflicted or miserable; no one was stupid or devoid of auspicious marks. All were unaffectedly good, pious and virtuous; all were clever and accomplished- both men and women. Everyone recognized the merits of others and was learned and wise; nay, everyone acknowledged the services and benefits received from others and there was no guileful prudence."

To him who has realized such infinite greatness of the Lord, even this description (viz., to speak of Him as the sovereign of the entire globe) will sound highly disparaging. But even those, O king of the birds, (continues Kākabhuśuṇḍi) who have realized the greatness of the Lord (as indicated above) have turned round and conceived a fondness for this story of the Lord. For the immediate perception of such exploits of the Lord is the reward of knowing His infinite greatness; so declare the greatest of sages that have subdued their senses. The happiness and prosperity of Śrī Rāma's reign were more than even Śeṣa (the serpent-god) and Śāradā (the goddess of learning) could describe. All were generous and all beneficent; men and women alike were devoted to the feet of the Brāhmaṇas. Every husband was pledged to a vow of monogamy and the wives too were devoted to their husband in thought, word and deed."

Birds sang and beasts fearlessly moved about in the woods in distinct herds, making merry all the time. The air breathed cool, soft and fragrant; bees hummed even as they moved about laden with honey. Creepers and trees dropped honey to those who asked for it; cows yielded milk to one's heart's content. The earth was ever clothed with crops; even in the Treta age the conditions of the Satyayuga prevailed. Conscious of the fact that the Ruler of the earth was no other than the Universal Spirit, the mountains brought to light their mines containing jewels of every description. Every river carried in it excellent water-cool, transparent and pleasant to the taste. The oceans kept within their bounds and scattered jewels on their shores for men to gather. Ponds were all thick with lotuses and every quarter was clear and bright."

A mine of beauty, virtuous and meek, Sītā was ever devoted to Her lord. She knew the greatness of the All-merciful Lord and adored His lotus-feet with a devoted heart. Although there were many man-servants and maid-servants in Her palace, all expert in the art of service, She did all household work with Her own hands and carried out the behests of Śrī Ramacandra. Sītā invariably did what would afford delight to the All-merciful, conversant as She was with the art of service. Devoid of pride and conceit, She waited upon Kausalya and all the other mothers-in-law in the palace. Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) Sītā was no other than Goddess Rāma (Lakṣmī), the Mother of the universe, who is adored even by Brahma and other gods and is ever flawless."

            "All the younger brothers served the Lord with great fidelity; for their love for Śrī Rāma knew no bounds. They ever kept gazing on His lotus face in the hope that the benign Lord might give some order to them at any moment. Śrī Rāma too loved His younger brothers and taught them wisdom of every kind. The citizens led a happy life and enjoyed all sorts of pleasures which even gods could scarcely obtain. Day and night they prayed to God and sought the boon of devotion to the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu's line). Sītā gave birth to two pretty sons, Lava and Kusa by name, who have figured in the Vedas and Purāṇas. Both these boys were victorious in battle, modest, accomplished and handsome, the very images as it were of Śrī Hari (Rāma). Śrī Rāma's other brothers too had two sons each, pre-eminent in comeliness of form, merit and virtue."

You, dear Garuḍa, are a favourite of Śrī Rāma and fond of hearing Śrī Hari's praises and a source of delight to me. I am, therefore, concealing nothing from you and tell you a profound and charming secret. Hear of Śrī Rāma's innate disposition: He never tolerates pride in His people. For pride is the root of metempsychosis and the cause of all kinds of pain and every form of grief. Hence the All-merciful gets rid of it in His extreme fondness for His servants, even as when a boil appears on the body of a child, my lord, the mother gets it opened like one having a stony heart.\""

The courtyard, where the four brothers played everyday, was magnificent beyond description. The Lord of the Raghus frolicked about in this yard carrying on childish pastimes that were the delight of His mother. His tender frame was dark of hue with a greenish tinge resembling that of the emerald; every limb of it had the loveliness of numberless Cupids compressed into it. His feet were soft and ruddy like a young lotus, with bright toes and nails that outshone the brilliance of the moon. They had soles bearing the fourfold lovely marks of the thunderbolt, the elephant-goad, the flag and the lotus, and were adorned with beautiful anklets that sweetly jingled. The charming zone about His waist, which was made of gold bossed with jewels produced a pleasant tinkling sound."

His eyes, which resembled a pair of blue lotuses, undid the bonds of worldly existence; while His forehead gleamed with a sacred mark made with yellow pigment. He had arched eyebrows, pretty well-matched ears and curly darkblue hair that scattered their charm all round. A thin yellow garment set off His swarthy person, and His shrill gleeful cry and glance captivated me. Thus frolicking in the courtyard of the royal palace, the All-beautiful danced at the sight of His own shadow and played with me in diverse ways, which I blush to tell you.

            "The moment I allowed this doubt to enter my mind, O king of the birds, Śrī Rāma's Māyā (delusive power) took possession of me as directed by the Lord of the Raghus. That Māyā, however, did not prove to be a source of trouble to me, nor did it throw me into the whirlpool of birth and death as it does in the case of other creatures. This, my lord, was attributable to some extraordinary reason. Hear it attentively, O mount of Śrī Hari, Sītā's Spouse alone is absolute intelligence; every creature, whether animate or inanimate, is subject to Māyā. If all had the same perfect wisdom, tell me, what would be the difference between God and the Jīva (the individual soul)? The latter, which identifies itself with a particular psycho-physical organism, is subject to Māyā; while Māyā itself, the source of the three Gunas, is controlled by God. The Jīva is dependent (subject to Māyā), while God is self-dependent. The Jivas are many, while the Beloved of Lakṣmī is one (without a second). Even though this difference, which has been created by Māyā, is false, it cannot disappear except by Śrī Hari's grace, whatever you may do."

That is why a servant of the Lord never falls; on the other hand, O best of birds, his devotion to the Lord as apart from himself grows. Śrī Rāma smiled to see me bewildered with error : now hear further particulars in this connection. The secret of this diversion nobody came to know, neither His younger brothers nor His parents. The Lord with a swarthy form and rosy hands and feet crawled on His hands and knees in order to catch me. Thereupon, O enemy of serpents, I took to flight. Śrī Rāma stretched out His arm to lay hold on me. Away as I flew into the air I saw Śrī Hari's arm close to me everywhere."

            "It seemed as if a hundred cycles had been spent in my wanderings through the many universes. At last after all my travels I came to my own hermitage and stayed there for sometime. Meanwhile as I happened to hear of my lord's birth at Ayodhyā I started up and ran in an overwhelming ecstasy of love and went and witnessed the grand festival of His birth as I have already told you at length. (It need hardly be said that all this happened inside the belly of my lord.) Thus in the belly of Śrī Rāma I beheld a number of universes. But what I saw could only be seen with one's eyes: it was beyond all telling. There again I beheld the divine Śrī Rāma, the gracious and all-wise Lord of Māyā. I pondered again and again. But my understanding was obscured by the mists of delusion. In less than an hour I had seen everything. My soul being utterly bewildered, I was lost in a maze."

The eyes alone had the blissful experience of beholding the Lord's beauty; but how could they describe it, devoid of speech as they are?

With tears in His eyes and His looks somewhat gloomy He looked at His mother (Kausalyā) as if He were hungry. Seeing this the mother started up in haste and ran; and addressing Him in soft words clasped Him to her bosom. Then, laying Him in her lap she began to suckle Him, singing the while of Śrī Rāma's charming exploits."

Listen, king of the birds : without Śrī Rāma's grace it is not possible to know the Lord's greatness. Without knowledge faith is out of the question; and without faith there can be no love.

I have not had recourse to any inventive skill; I have seen all this with my own eyes. Śrī Rāma's greatness, His Name, beauty and the song of His praises, they are all boundless and endless; and the Lord of the Raghus Himself is infinite. The sages sing Śrī Hari's praises each according to his wits; but neither the Vedas nor Śeṣa (the serpent-god) nor the blessed Śiva Himself can reach their end. All winged creatures, from yourself down to the mosquito, take their flight across the sky; but none can reach the end of it. Even so, dear Garuḍa, can anyone ever gauge the exent of Śrī Rāma's greatness, unfathomable as it is ? Śrī Rāma's body possesses the charm of a myriad Cupids. He is as inexorable in crushing the enemy as countless millions of Durgas. He enjoys the luxury of a myriad Indras and is immeasurable in expanse as a myriad firmaments."

Your question is very pleasing to me. On hearing your loving and agreeable question I have been reminded of many previous births. I shall now narrate the whole of my story at full length; dear Garuḍa, listen to it attentively with all reverence. The muttering of prayers, austere penance, performing sacrifices, subjugation of the mind and the senses, undertaking sacred vows, charity, dispassion, right judgment, Yoga (union with God) and Realization-the fruit of all these is devotion to the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus); without this no one can attain lasting peace. It was in this body that I was blessed with devotion to Śrī Rāma; hence it is so very dear to me. Everyone naturally loves that through which one has attained one's object."

Although my death depends on my own will, I refuse to quit this body, because-as the Vedas declare- adoration of the Lord is not possible without a corporeal frame. At first infatuation gave me much trouble; so long as I remained hostile to Śrī Rāma I never had a restful sleep. Through a number births I practised Yoga (concentration of mind), Japa (muttering of prayers), austere penance and charity and performed sacrifices and other acts of various kinds. Which species is there in this world, O lord of the winged creatures, in which I have not at sometime been born during my round of births? I have had experience of all kinds of pursuits, my lord; but I was never so happy as I am now. I recollect many previous existences, my lord, in which by Śiva grace my understanding was not clouded by infatuation."

All men are given over to sensuality and greed and irascible too, and are hostile to the gods; the Brāhmaṇas, the Vedas as well as to the saints. Unfortunate wives desert their accomplished and handsome husband and bestow their heart on a paramour. Wives having their husband alive have no ornament on their person, while widows adorn themselves in the latest style. The disciple and the preceptor severally resemble a deaf man and a blind man : the one would not listen, while the other cannot see. A spiritual guide who robs his disciple of money but fails to rid him of his sorrow is cast into a terrible hell. Parents call their children and teach them such religion as may fill their belly."

They who find fault with the Vedas by dint of logic are condemned to each hell for a whole Kalpa (cycle). People of the lowest grade in society such as oil-men, potters, the outcaste (lit., those who cook and feed on the flesh of a dog), the Kirātas and Kolas and the distillers of spirituous liquors get their heads shaved and enter the order of Samnyasa (renunciation) when their wife is no more in this world and they have lost their household property. They allow themselves to be worshipped by the Brāhmaṇas and bring ruin to themselves here as well as hereafter. As for the Brāhmaṇas, they are unlettered, grasping, lascivious, reprobate and stupid and marry low-caste women of a lewd character. Sμudras, on the other hand, practise Japa (the muttering of prayers) and austere penance, undertake sacred vows of various kinds and expound the Purāṇas from an exalted seat. All men follow a course of conduct of their own imagination; the endless variety of wrongdoing cannot be described in words."

Men drive out a well-born and virtuous wife and bring home some servant-girl, casting to the winds all good usage. Sons respect their father and mother only so long as they have not seen the face of their wife. From the time they take a fancy to their wife's kinsfolk they begin to look upon their own people as their enemies. Kings get addicted to sin and cease to have anything to do with piety. They ever persecute their subjects by inflicting unmerited punishment on them. The meanest churl, if he is rich, is accounted noble. A Brāhmaṇa is known only by his sacred thread, and an ascetic by his naked body. He who refuses to recognize the Vedas and Purāṇas is a true saint and servant of Śrī Hari in the Kali age. Poets are seen in large numbers; but the munificent (who reward them) are seldom heard of. Those who find fault with others' virtues can be had in any number, but no one possessing virtues. In the Kali age famines are of frequent occurrence: for want of foodgrains people perish miserably en masse."

            "In the Satyayuga everyone is possessed of mystic powers and wise too. Hence in that age men cross the ocean of mundane existence by meditating on Śrī Hari. In the Treta age men perform sacrifices of various kinds and cross the ocean of metempsychosis by dedicating their actions to the Lord. In the Dvāpara age men cross the ocean of worldly existence by adoring the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), there being no other means to do it. In the Kali age, however, men reach the end of mundane existence simply by singing Śrī Hari's praises. In the age of Kali neither Yoga (concentration of mind), nor the performance of sacrifices nor spiritual wisdom is of any avail; one's only hope lies in hymning Śrī Rāma's praises. Giving up all other hopes, whosoever worships Śrī Rāma and fondly chants His praises undoubtedly crosses the ocean of transmigration. The power of the Name is thus manifest in the age of Kali. The Kali age possesses another sacred virtue: in this age projected acts of virtue are rewarded, but projected sins are not punished."

Abundance of Sattva with a slight admixture of Rajas, attachment to action, and happiness of every kind are the characteristics of Treta. Much Rajas, little Sattva, and some Tamas, with a feeling of mingled joy and terror in the heart, are the distinguishing features of Dvāpara. A large proportion of Tamas with a slight admixture of Rajas and antagonism everywhere are the effects of Kali. The wise discern the characteristics of the different Yugas in their mind and forswearing unrighteousness devote themselves to piety. The characteristics of the Time-Spirit have no effect on him who is excessively fond of Śrī Rāma's feet. The deception practised by a juggler, O king of the birds, is formidable indeed: but the tricks of a juggler cannot deceive his servant."

When sometime had elapsed, I acquired some wealth and after that I began worshipping Lord Śambhu at that very place. There was a Brāhmaṇa there who constantly worshipped Lord Śiva according to the Vedic rites and had no other occupation. He was an extremely pious soul and a knower of the highest truth, a votary of Lord Śambhu but no reviler of Śrī Hari. I served him though with a guileful heart. The Brāhmaṇa was very kind-hearted and an abode of piety. Seeing me outwardly so humble, my Lord, the Brāhmaṇa taught me as his own son. The great Brāhmaṇa imparted to me a mystic formula sacred to Lord Śambhu and gave me every kind of good advice. I used to go to a temple of Lord Śiva and repeat the formula there with unbounded ostentation and conceit in my heart."

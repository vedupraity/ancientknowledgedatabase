            "Thereupon the great sage recounted with reverence a few virtues of Sri Rama (the Lord of the Raghus), O lord of the feathered creation. But himself devoted to the knowledge of Brahma (the Absolute), and knowing me to be the fittest person (to be initiated into such knowledge), the enlightened sage began a sermon on Brahma, the unborn, the One without a second and without attributes, the Ruler of the heart (the inner Controller), incomprehensible, desireless, without name or form, attainable only through realization, indivisible and incomparable, beyond the mind and the senses, immaculate and indestructible, immutable, unlimited and all-blissful : \"You are identical with the Brahma referred to above; no more difference exists between Him and you than between a sheet of water and the ripples on its surface: so declare the Vedas.\" The sage instructed me in various ways; but the truth that the individual soul is identical with the attributeless Brahma did not appeal to my heart. Bowing my head at his feet I submitted again, \"Kindly tell me how to worship the embodied Brahma, O lord of the sages. My mind takes delight in the worship of Sri Rama even as a fish rejoiees in water; how, then, can it exist without it, O wise lord of the sages? Be gracious, therefore, to teach me the method whereby I may be able to behold the Lord of the Raghus with my own eyes. Having feasted my eyes on the King of Ayodhya I will then listen to your discourse on the attributeless Brahma.\" The sage once more recited the incomparable story of Sri Hari; but demolishing the doctrine that the supreme Spirit does appear in an embodied form, he established the proposition that He is ever without attributes. Thereupon I would set aside the view that God is ever attributeless and establish with great obstinacy the doctrine that He takes an embodied form. When I thus entered into hot discussion with him, signs of resentment appeared on the sage's person. Listen, my lord: insolence carried to an excess rouses passion even in the breast of an enlightened soul. Too much friction will produce fire even out of sandal-wood."

Can one continue to perform actions (with attachment) even after attaining Self-Realization? Has anyone acquired sound wisdom while living in the company of the vicious? Can an adulterer attain a happy destiny? Can those who have realized God fall again into the ocean of transmigration? Can the revilers of Sri Hari be ever happy?

            "Listen, O lord of the winged creatures : the sage was in no way at fault; it is Sri Rama (the Ornament of Raghu's race) who prompts all hearts. The All-merciful put my devotion to the test by clouding the sage's reason. When He came to know that I was His devoted servant in thought, word and deed, the Lord disabused the saint again. The sage was amazed at my extraordinary forbearance and the unique faith in Sri Rama's feet and, repenting again and again politely called me back. He consoled me in everyway and then gladly imparted to me the formula sacred to Sri Rama. The gracious sage also taught me how to meditate on Sri Rama as a child. The form which I was thus taught to fix my thoughts upon, charming and delightful as it was, pleased me much; I have already told you the same. The sage detained me in his hermitage for sometime and then recited the \"Ramacaritamanasa\" (the Manasa lake of Sri Rama's exploits). Having reverently repeated the story the sage then addressed me in the following gracious words : \"I discovered this secret and charming lake of Sri Rama's exploits, dear son, by the grace of Lord Sambhu. I have come to know that you are a beloved devotee of Sri Rama; hence I recited it to you in full. Never repeat it, dear child, in the presence of those whose heart is void of devotion to Sri Rama.\" The sage admonished me in various ways and I lovingly bowed my head at his feet. The great sage touched my head with his lotus palm and gladly gave me his blessing : \"Henceforth, by my grace, devotion to Sri Rama shall ever abide in your heart and know no interruption."

            "\"No suffering occasioned by time, fate, merit, demerit or disposition shall ever torment you. The manifold charming mysteries of Sri Rama, that are found mentioned in the chronicles and Puranas either explicitly or implicitly, you will come to know without any difficulty; and the flame of your devotion to Sri Rama's feet will grow ever brighter and brighter. Whatever longing you may entertain in your mind, you shall have no difficulty in attaining it by the grace of Sri Hari.\" On hearing the sage's benediction, mark me, O Garuda of steadfast reason, a deep voice-which was evidently the voice of the Supreme Spirit-was heard from the heavens: \"May your prophesy come to be true, O enlightened sage ! He is My votary in thought, word and deed.\" I rejoiced to hear the heavenly voice and stood overwhelmed with love and rid of all my doubts. On receiving the sage's permission in response to my prayer I repeatedly bowed my head at his feet and gladly came away to this hermitage, having obtained by the Lord's grace a rare boon. Listen, O lord of the feathered creation : I have now lived in this hermitage for seven and twenty rounds of creation. I am ever engaged in hymning the praises of Sri Rama (the Lord of the Raghus), while enlightened birds reverently listen to them. Each time the Hero of Raghu's line assumes the form of a man in the city of Ayodhya for the sake of His devotees I go and stay at the capital of Sri Rama and enjoy the spectacle of His childish sports. Again, enshrining an image of the child Rama in my heart I return to my hermitage, O king of the birds. I have now told you all the circumstances that invested me with the form of a crow, and have also replied to all your queries. The glory of devotion to Sri Rama is superb indeed."

The All-merciful Rāma next called Bharata and disentangled his matted hair with His own hands. The gracious and almighty Lord of the Raghus, who is so fond of His devotees, now bathed all His three brothers. The blessedness of Bharata and the Lord's tenderness were both more than countless Śeṣas could sing. Then Śrī Rāma disentangled His own matted hair, and after obtaining the Guru's permission bathed Himself. Having finished His ablutions, the Lord decked Himself with jewels; the beauty of His person put to shame hundreds of Cupids."

Then the Brāhmaṇas recited the Vedic hymns, while in the heavens above the gods and sage shouted, \"Victory! Victory!\" The sage Vasiṣṭha first of all applied the sacred mark himself and then he directed all the other Brāhmaṇas to do likewise. The mothers were transported with joy at the sight of their son and waved lights above His head again and again. They bestowed a variety of gifts on the Brāhmaṇas and gave the beggars so much that they begged no more. Perceiving the lord of all the three spheres seated on the throne of Ayodhyā the gods sounded their kettledrums."

You killed by the might of Your arm fierce, mighty and wicked demons like the ten-headed Rāvaṇa. Appearing in human garb, you crushed the armies that constituted the Earth's burden and ended her terrible woes. Hail, merciful Lord, Protector of the suppliant ! We adore you with Your Spouse. Subject to Your relentless Māyā (deluding potency), O Hari, gods and demons, Nāgas and human beings, nay, all animate and inanimate beings wander for numberless days and nights in the path of metempsychosis impelled by Time, Karma (destiny) and the Gunas (modes of Prakṛti). Those, O Lord, whom You ever regarded with compassion have been rid of the threefold affliction. Protect us, Rāma, prompt as You are in putting an end to the toils of mundane existence; we adore You. Intoxicated with the pride of wisdom, they who respect not Devotion to You, which takes away the fear of transmigration, may climb up to a rank which even gods find it difficult to attain; yet, O Hari, we see them fall from it. On the other hand, they who have abandoned all other hopes and with unqualified faith choose to remain Your servants easily cross the ocean of transmigration by merely repeating Your name. It is for this reason, O Lord, that we particularly invoke You. O Mukunda (Bestower of Liberation), O Rāma, O Lord of Rāma (Lakṣmī), we ever adore Your lotus-feet, which are worthy of adoration to Lord Śiva and the unborn Brahma, the touch of whose blessed dust redeemed Ahalyā (the wife of the sage Gautama), from whose nails flowed the heavenly stream (Gaṅgā)-which is reverenced even by the sages and sanctifies all the three spheres- and the soles of which, while bearing the marks of a flag, thunderbolt, goad and lotus, are further adorned by scars left by thorns that pricked them in course of Your wanderings in the forest. We further adore You as the tree of the universe, which, as the Vedas and the Āgamas (Tantras) declare, has its root in the Unmanifest (Brahma) and has existed from time without beginning; which has four coats* of bark, six stems, twenty-five boughs, numberless leaves and abundant flowers; which bears two kinds of fruits-bitter and sweet, which has a solitary creeper clinging to it and which puts on ever fresh foliage and evernew flowers. Let those who meditate on Brahma (the Absolute) as unborn, the one without a second, perceptible only through intuition and as beyond the ken of mind, preach and believe like that. We, for our part, O Lord, ever chant the glories of Your visible form. O All-merciful and All-effulgent Lord, O mine of noble virtues, this is the boon we ask of You: may we love Your feet, casting off all aberrations of thought, word and deed.\""

            "\"Hail to You, Rāma, Rāma's (Sītā's) Spouse, Reliever of the afflictions of worldly existence ! Protect this servant, who is obsessed with the fear of transmigration. O King of Ayodhyā, Ruler of the gods, Lord of Lakṣmī, all-pervading Master! Having fled to You for refuge, I implore You: pray, extend Your protection to Me. By disposing of Rāvaṇa who possessed as many as ten heads and twenty arms. You rid the earth of many a severe scourge. The hosts of demons were a veritable swarm of moths that were reduced to ashes by the fierce glow of Your fire-like arrows. An exceedingly beautiful jewel of the terrestrial globe, You have armed Yourself with an excellent bow, arrows and quiver. You are a radiant sun as it were to disperse the thick darkness prevailing in the night of pride, gross ignorance and attachment. The hunter in the form of lust has laid low the human deer by piercing his heart with the shafts of evil desire: O Lord ! pray, kill the hunter and thus save the life of these poor helpless creatures, lost as they are in the wilderness of sensuality, O Hari ! People are stricken with a host of diseases and bereavements, which are surely the result of neglecting Your feet. Those men who cherish no love for your lotus-feet continue to drift in the fathomless ocean of mundane existence. They are ever most wretched, impure and unhappy, who have no devotion to Your lotus-feet. On the other hand, they who derive their sustenance from Your stories hold the saints and the eternal Lord (Yourself) as constantly dear to them. They are free from passion, greed, pride and arrogance; prosperity and adversity are alike to them. That is why sages give up forever all faith in Yoga (mental discipline) and gladly become Your servants. With a pure heart and under a solemn pledge they constantly and lovingly adore Your lotus-feet. Regarding honour and ignominy alike, all such saints move about happily on earth. O Hero of Raghu's line, invincible and exceedingly staunch in battle, indwelling as a bee the lotus heart of sages, I take refuge in You. I repeat Your Name and bow to You, O Hari; You are a sovereign remedy for the disease of birth and death and an enemy of pride. I constantly greet You, Lakṣmī's Spouse, supreme abode of goodness, amiability and compassion. O Delight of the Raghus, put an end to all pairs of contrary experiences (such as joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, attraction and repulsion, etc.); O Ruler of the earth, just cast a glance on this humble servant."

            "Listen, O king of the birds, (continues Kākabhuśuṇḍi): this story purifies the heart and rids one of the threefold affliction and the fear of birth and death. By hearing the narrative of King Rāma's blessed Coronation men acquire dispassion and discernment. Those men who hear or sing it with some interested motive attain happiness and prosperity of every kind; after enjoying in this world pleasures to which even gods can scarce attain they ascend to Śrī Rāma's divine Abode at the end of their earthly career. If a liberated soul, a man of dispassion and a sensual person hear it, they severally obtain Devotion, final beatitude and everincreasing prosperity. O king of the birds, (continues Kākabhuśuṇḍi,) the story of Śrī Rāma, that I have narrated according to my own lights, takes away the fear of birth and death and rids one of sorrow. It confirms one's dispassion, discernment and devotion and is a splendid boat to take one across the river of ignorance. Everyday there was some new rejoicing in Kosalapura (the city of Ayodhyā) people of all classes were happy. Everybody cherished an ever-growing affection for Śrī Rāma's lotus-feet, which are adored even by Lord Śiva, Brahma (the Unborn) and the sages. Mendicants were provided with clothes of various kinds; while the twice-born (Brāhmaṇas) received gifts of every description."

Having gone out they saw the lovely royal garden, enamoured of whose beauty the vernal season had taken its permanent abode there. It was planted with charming trees of various kinds and overhung with beautiful creepers of different colours. Rich in fresh leaf, fruit and flower they put to shame even celestial trees by their wealth. The feathered choir of the Catakas, cuckoos, parrots and Cakoras warbled and peacocks beautifully danced. In the centre of the garden a lovely lake shone bright with flights of steps made of many-coloured gems. Its limpid water contained lotuses of various colours and was vocal with the cooing of aquatic birds and the humming of bees."

They sang melodies in an enchanting voice. Close to the lake stood a temple, sacred to Girijā, which was beautiful beyond description, and captivated the mind of those who looked at it. Having taken a dip into the lake with Her companions, Sītā went with a glad heart to Girijā's temple. She offered worship with great devotion and begged of the Goddess a handsome match worthy of Her. One of Her companions had strayed away from Her in order to have a look at the garden. She chanced to behold the two brothers and returned to Sītā overwhelmed with love."

She has been escorted by her girl-companions to worship Goddess Gaurī and is moving about in the garden diffusing light all about her. My heart which is naturally pure, is agitated by the sight of Her transcendent beauty. The reason of all this is known to God alone; but I tell you, brother, my right limbs are throbbing, which is an index of coming good fortune. It is a natural trait with the race of Raghu that they never set their heart on evil courses. As for myself I am fully confident of My mind, which has never sought another's wife even in a dream. Rare in this world are those noble men who never turn their back on the foe in battle nor give their heart to or cast an amorous glance on another's wife, and from whom no beggar meets with a rebuff."

Wherever the fawneyed princess cast Her glance, a continuous stream of white lotuses seemed to rain there. Her companions then pointed out to Her the two lovely brothers, the one dark, the other fair of hue, standing behind a fence of creepers. Beholding the beauty of the two princes Her eyes were filled with greed; they rejoiced as if they had discovered their longlost treasure. The eyes became motionless at the sight of Śrī Rāma's loveliness; the eyelids too forgot to fall. Due to excess of love Her body-consciousness began to fail; it looked as if a Cakora bird were gazing at the autumnal moon. Receiving Śrī Rāma into the heart through the passage of the eyes, She cleverly shut Him up there by closing the doors of Her eyelids. When Her girl-companions found Sītā overpowered with love, they were too much abashed to utter a word."

A sectarian mark and beads of perspiration glistened on their brow; while graceful pendants shed their lustre on their ears. With arched eyebrows and curly locks, eyes red as a lotus-bud and a lovely chin, nose and cheeks their gracious smile was soul-enthralling. The beauty of their countenance was more than I can describe; it would put to shame a myriad Cupids. They had a string of jewels on their breast; their lovely neck resembled a conch-shell in its spiral shape; while their mighty arms vied with the trunk of a young elephant, who was the very incarnation of Cupid. With a cup of leaves full of flowers in His left hand the dark-hued prince, my dear, is most charming."

Surveying Śrī Rāma's beauty from head to foot in the reverse order,* and remembering Her father's vow she felt much perturbed. When Sītā's companions saw Her thus overcome with love, they all cried in alarm: \"We are late already.\" \"Let us come again at this very hour tomorrow !\" So saying one of them smiled within herself. Sītā blushed at this pregnant remark. She got afraid of Her mother; for she felt it was already late. Recovering Herself with considerable effort she received Śrī Rāma into Her heart and conscious of Her dependence on Her sire returned home."

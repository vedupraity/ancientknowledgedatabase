They had a daughter too, Devahũti by name, who was the favourite consort of the sage Kardama, and who bore in her womb the all-powerful and benevolent Lord Kapila the primal divinity, who is compassionate to the humble and who openly expounded the philosophy of Sāṅkhya, an adept as He was in the enquiry after the ultimate principles. The said Manu ruled for a long period and followed the Lord's commandments (in the form of the scriptural ordinance) in everyway."

Multitudes of sages and adepts lived there. Glad of heart, king Manu proceeded to that place. Passing along the road, the king and queen of resolute mind looked like incarnations of spiritual wisdom and devotion respectively. On reaching the bank of the Gomatī they bathed with delight in the limpid stream. Adepts and enlightened sages came to see him, recognizing in the royal sage a champion of virtue. The sages reverently took them to all holy and lovely spots that were scattered here and there. With emaciated bodies and clad in hermits' robes they daily listened to the Purāṇas in the assembly of saints."

I Myself, O king, shall be a son to you.\" Then, seeing Śatarũpā with her hands still folded, He said, \"O good lady, ask whatever boon you please.\" \"O gracious Lord, the boon which the clever king has just asked has appealed to me much. But it is great presumption, my Lord, even though such presumption is liked by You, O friend of the devotees. You are the progenitor even of Brahma and other gods, the lord of the universe and the Supreme Being who dwells within the heart of all. Realizing this, my mind is filled with doubt; but what You have said is infallible. O my master, the bliss that is enjoyed and the goal that is reached by your own devotees-"

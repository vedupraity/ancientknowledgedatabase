My lord, your command must be respectfully carried out: this is my paramount duty. The words of one's parents, teacher and master must be unquestionably obeyed as conducive to bliss. You are my supreme benefactor in everyway; therefore, my lord, I bow to Your commands.\" The Lord, was pleased to hear the well-chosen words of Śaṅkara; which were inspired with devotion, wisdom and piety. The Lord said, \"Your vow has been kept; now bear in mind what I have told You.\" Saying so He went out of sight. Śaṅkara cherished the impression of the vision in His heart. That very moment the seven sages called on Śiva. The Lord spoke to them in most charming accents:- (1-4)"

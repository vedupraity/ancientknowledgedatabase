She held in one of Her lotus hands the fair wreath of victory, resplendent with the glory of triumph over the whole universe. While Her body shrank with modesty, Her heart was full of rapture; Her hidden love could not be perceived by others. As She drew near and beheld Śrī Rāma's beauty, Princess Sītā stood motionless as a portrait. A clever companion, who perceived Her in this condition, exhorted Her saying,\" Invest the bridegroom with the beautiful wreath of victory.\" At this She raised the wreath with both of Her hands, but was too overwhelmed with emotion to garland Him. In this act Her uplifted hands shone as if a pair of lotuses with their stalks were timidly investing the moon with a wreath of victory. At this charming sight Her companions broke into a song, while Sītā placed the wreath of victory round Śrī Rāma's neck so as to adorn His breast."

The pair of Śrī Rāma and Sītā shone as if beauty and the sentiment of Love had met together in human form. Her companions urged Her,\"Sītā, clasp your lord's feet.\" But Sītā was too much afraid to touch His feet."

Should Janaka come forward to help them, rout him in battle alongwith the two brothers.\" When the good kings heard these words, they said, \"Shame itself feels shy in approaching this assembly of princes.

At his very sight the kings all cowered down even as a quail would shrink beneath the swoop of a hawk. A coat of ashes looked most charming on his fair body; his broad forehead was adorned with a Tripuṇḍra (as peculiar mark consisting of three horizontal lines, sacred to Śiva). Having matted locks on the head, his handsome moonlike face was a bit reddened with anger; with knitted brows and eyes inflamed with passion, his natural look gave one the impression that he was enraged. He had well-built shoulders like those of a bull and a broad chest and long arms; he was adorned with a beautiful sacred thread, rosary and deerskin. With an anchorite's covering about his loins and a pair of quivers fastened by his side, he held a bow and arrows in his hands and an axe upon his fair shoulder."

Next came Viśvāmitra, who met him and placed the two brothers at his lotus feet, saying that they were King Daśaratha's sons, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa by name; seeing the well-matched pair, he blessed them.

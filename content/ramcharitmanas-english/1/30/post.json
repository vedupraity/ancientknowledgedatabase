Where dwells the abode of Laksmi, Bhagavan Narayana, who is Vedanta (the crown of all Vedas) personified. The abode of Rama (Laksmi) rose to meet him in great joy and shared His seat with the sage. The Lord of the entire creation, animate as well as inanimate, said with a smile, \"It is after a long time that you have showed Me this favour, reverend sir.\" Narada told Him all the doings of Love, even though Siva had already forbidden him to do so. Most formidable is the Maya (deluding potency) of the Lord of Raghus. No one was ever born in this world, who is beyond its charm."

He possessed the grandeur and luxury of a hundred Indras, and was a repository of grace, splendour, might and wisdom. He had a daughter, Visvamohini by name, whose beauty enraptured even Laksmi. She was no other than Sri Hari's own Maya (enrapturing potency), the fountainhead of all virtues; who can describe her charm? The princess was going to marry by self-choice; hence kings beyond number arrived there as suitors. The sportive sage (Narada) entered the city and inquired everything from the people. Hearing all that had been going on there, he wended his way to the king's palace. The king paid him homage and gave him a seat."

Why, then, be angry, reverend sir, for no cause?\" Casting a glance at his axe, Paraśurāma replied, \"O foolish child, have you never heard of my temper ? I slay you not because, as I say, you are a child yet; do you take me for a mere anchorite, O dullard? I have been a celibate from my very boyhood, but also an irascible one; and I am known throughout the world as a sworn enemy of the Kṣatriya race. By the might of my arm I made the earth kingless and bestowed it time after time upon the Brāhmaṇas. Look at this axe, which lopped off the arms of Sahasrabāhu (the thousandarmed Kartavirya), O youthful prince."

Now that I understand you are a descendant of Bhrgu and perceive a sacred thread on your person, I suppress my anger and put up with whatever you say. In our family valour is never shown against gods, the Brāhmaṇas, devotees of Śrī Hari and the cow; for by killing any of these we incur sin while a defeat at their hands will bring disrepute on us.

For he who is born as a Kṣatriya, and is yet afraid of fighting, is a veritable wretch and has brought a slur on his lineage. I tell you in my natural way and not by way of a tribute to my race: Raghu's descendants do not tremble to meet in fight even Death. Such is the glory of the Brāhmaṇa race that he who is afraid of you (Brāhmaṇas) is rid of all fear.\" When he heard these soft yet profound words of Śrī Rāma, Paraśurāma's mind was disillusioned. \"O Rāma, take this bow of Rāma's lord and draw it, so that my doubts may be cleared.\"* As Paraśurāma offered his bow it passed into Rāma's hands of its own accord, and Paraśurāma felt amazed at this."

Glory to the Benefactor of gods, Brāhmaṇas and cows ! Glory to Him who takes away pride, ignorance, passion and delusion ! Glory to Him who is an ocean of humility, amiability, compassion and goodness and a pastmaster in the art of speech. Glory to the Delighter of His servants and to Him who is graceful of every limb and whose form possesses the beauty of millions of Cupids ! How can I with one tongue utter Your praises? Glory to Him who sports in the mind of the great Lord Śiva as a swan in the Mānasarovara lake ! In my ignorance I have said much that was unseemly; therefore pardon me, both brothers, abodes of forgiveness that You are. Glory, glory, all glory to the Chief of Raghu's race !\" So saying, the lord of Bhrgus withdrew to the forest to practise penance. The wicked kings were all seized with imaginary fears and the cowards quietly fled in all directions."

Janaka made obeisance before Kausika and said, ''It is due to your grace, my lord, that Śrī Rāma has been able to break the bow. The two brothers have gained me my purpose; pray tell me now, reverend sir, what it behoves me to do.\" Said the sage, ''Listen, wise king: the marriage depended on the bow, and took place directly the bow broke, as is well-known to all, including gods, human beings and Nāgas.\""

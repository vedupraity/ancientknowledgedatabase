On hearing the sage's bright glory the king praised to himself the value of his stock of merits (which attracted the sage to his house and won for him his favour). At the royal command the people dispersed, while the king with his sons returned to his palace. Everywhere the people sang the story of Śrī Rāma's wedding, and His holy and fair fame was diffused through all the three spheres. From the day Śrī Rāma came home duly married, every kind of joy took its abode in Ayodhyā. The festivities that followed the Lord's wedding were more than the goddess of speech or the Lord of serpents, Śeṣa, could tell. I know that the glory of Śrī Rāma and Sītā is the very life and sanctifier of the race of poets and a mine of blessings; that is why I have said something about it just to hallow my speech"

O great Lord Śiva and Bhavānī, and reward my services by lightening the weight of the bow out of affection for me. O god Gaṇeśa, the chief of Śiva attendants, O bestower of boons, it is for this day that I have adored You. Listening to my repeated supplication, therefore, reduce the weight of the bow to a mere trifle.\""

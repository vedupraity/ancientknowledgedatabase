They all decorated their own beautiful houses as well as the markets, streets, squares and gates of the city. All the lanes were watered with perfumes; here and there festal squares were filled in with elegant devices. The bazar was beautified beyond all description with festal arches, flags, banners and canopies. Trees of the areca-nut, the plantain, the mango, the Bakula, the Kadamba and the Tamāla were transplanted alongwith their fruit. The beautiful trees thus planted touched the ground (on account of their being laden with fruits); they had basins of precious stones constructed around them with exquisite skill."

Tell me who would not feel tempted to have a look at Śrī Rāma and Videha's Daughter? Married women, whose husbands were alive, sallied forth in troops, each eclipsing Love's consort (Rati) by her beauty. They all carried articles of good omen and were equipped with lights for waving round the bridegrooms. As they moved along singing all the way, it appeared as if Goddess Bhāratī (the goddess of speech) had appeared in so many forms. The king's palace was full of hilarious tumult; the joy of the occasion was ineffable. Kausalyā and other mothers of Śrī Rāma were so overwhelmed with emotion that they forgot their own body."

Exceedingly charming gold vases, painted with various colours, looked like nests built by Cupid's own birds. Auspicious perfumes defied all description.

Musical instruments of all kinds began to play; gods in heaven and men in the city were enraptured alike. Members of the bridegroom's party looked smart beyond description. They were highly delighted and could not contain themselves for joy. The people of Ayodhyā then greeted the king, and were gladdened at the very sight of Śrī Rāma. They scattered about Him jewels and vestments; their eyes were full of tears and their body thrilled over. The women of the city gladly waved lights around His head and rejoiced to see the four noble princes. They were all the more gratified when they lifted the curtains of the beautiful palanquins and beheld the brides."

Even while you and your brother (Lakṣmaṇa) guarded the sacrifice, you were initiated into all the secret lore. At the mere touch of the dust from your feet the hermit's wife (Ahalyā) attained salvation and your glory filled the whole universe. In the assembly of princes you broke Śiva bow, hard though it was as a tortoise-shell or adamant or rock. You gained the glory of having triumphed over the world and won the hand of Janaka's daughter, and then returned home after marrying all your brothers. All your actions have been superhuman and were accomplished only by the grace of the sage Kauśika. Our birth into the world has borne fruit today as we now behold, dear child, your moon-like face. Our prayer is that the number of days that have been spent without seeing you, may not be reckoned by the Creator at all.\""

The sage Vasiṣṭha narrated sacred legends, while the king and the ladies of the gynaeceum listened. In the course of his narration the sage gladly recounted in diverse ways the doings of Viśvāmitra, that surpassed the imagination even of hermits. Vāmadeva (another family preceptor of King Daśaratha) observed that whatever Vasiṣṭha said was true and that Viśvāmitra's fair renown had pervaded all the three spheres. Everyone rejoiced to hear that, while Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were all the more delighted at heart."

Viśvāmitra intended leaving everyday, but was detained by Śrī Rāma's affectionate entreaties. Seeing the king's devotion to him grow a hundredfold day after day the great sage Viśvāmitra was full of praise for him. At last when he asked permission to go, the king was greatly moved and with his sons stood before him saying, \"My lord, all that I have is yours; while I and my sons and wives are your servants. Be ever gracious to these boys and condescend from time to time to bless me with your sight.\" So saying, the king with his sons and queens fell at his feet, and speech failed his tongue. The Brāhmaṇa (Viśvāmitra) invoked upon him every kind of blessing and departed amidst a scene of love that defied all description. Śrī Rāma and all His brothers lovingly escorted him and returned only when they were allowed to go back."

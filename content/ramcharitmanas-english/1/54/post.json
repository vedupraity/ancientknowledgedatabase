These creepers were intertwined into so many cords (for holding the bamboos together) with beautiful strings of pearls inserted here and there. After much cutting, carving and inlaying they made lotuses of rubies, emeralds, diamonds and turquoises. They also fashioned bees and birds of varied plumage, which buzzed and whistled in the restling breeze. On the pillars they sculptured images of gods, all standing with articles of good omen in their hands. Squares were drawn on the floor in various naturally charming devices and filled in with elephant pearls."

The one dark and the other fair of hue, they are equipped with bow and quiver and are of tender age and accompanied by the sage Kauśika. Do you recognize them? If so, tell me something about their temperament.\" Overwhelmed with love the king asked thus again and again. \"From the day the sage took them away it is only today that I have obtained authentic news about them. Tell me how King Videha was able to know them.\" At these fond words the messengers smiled."

All rejoiced to hear the message and the king himself related the other tidings which he had heard from the lips of the messengers. Bursting with emotion the queens shone like pea-hens rejoicing at the rumbling of clouds. The preceptor's wife and the wives of other elders in their joy invoked the blessings of heaven and the mothers of the four brothers were overwhelmed with ecstasy. They took the most beloved letter from each other and pressing it to their bosom cooled their burning heart. The great king recounted again and again the glory and exploits of both Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, saying that it was all due to the sage's grace he went out of doors. The queens then sent for the Brāhmaṇas and joyfully bestowed gifts on them. And the Brāhmaṇas returned to their home uttering blessings."

How is the king's palace to be described; the pavilion set up there would dazzle the whole universe. Various articles of good omen and charming in appearance were displayed and a number of kettledrums were sounded. Here were panegyrists singing the family glory and here were Brāhmaṇas chanting the Vedas; while pretty women carolled festive songs, many times repeating the names of Rāma and Sītā. There was an excess of joy all round, while the palace was too small to contain it; it seemed, therefore, as if it overflowed on all sides."

At the entrance of the king's palace, there was such an enormous crowd that a stone thrown there would be trodden into dust. Women viewed the sight from house-tops, carrying festal lights in salvers used on auspicious occasions, and carolled melodious strains of various kinds in an ecstasy of joy beyond description. Then Sumantra (King Daśaratha's own charioteer and trusted counsellor) got ready a pair of chariots and yoked them with steeds that would outrun even the horses of the sun-god, and brought them in all their splendour before the king; their beauty was more than goddess Śāradā could describe. One of them was equipped with the royal paraphernalia while the other was a mass of splendour and shone brightly."

            "Auspicious omens easily occur to him who has God with form as his own son. In the marriage which was going to take place, the bridegroom was no other than Śrī Rāma and Sītā Herself was the bride; while the pious Daśaratha and Janaka were the parents of the bridegroom and the bride respectively; hearing of this marriage all good omens danced and said, \"It is now that the Creator has justified us.\" In this way the procession set forth amidst the neighing of horses, the trumpeting of elephants and the clash of kettledrums. Learning that the chief of the solar race, King Daśaratha, was already on the way, King Janaka had the rivers bridged, and got beautiful rest-houses erected at different stages, which vied in magnificence with the city of immortals (Amarāvatī), and in which members of the bridegroom's party were supplied with excellent food, beds and clothing each according to his own taste. Finding ever new pleasures agreeable to themselves all the members of the bridegroom's party forgot their own home."

The gods were feeling exhilarated and the saints were bubbling with enthusiasm. The woods were full of blossoms, the mountains were resplendent with gems and every river flowed a stream of nectar. When Brahma perceived that the time of Sri Rama's birth had approached, all the gods came out with their aerial cars duly equipped. The bright heaven was crowded with their hosts and troops of Gandharvas chanted praises and rained down flowers placing them in their beautiful palms. The sky resounded with the beat of kettedrums. Nagas, sages and gods offered praises and tendered their services in manifold ways."

            "The gracious Lord, who is compassionate to the lowly and the benefactor of Kausalya appeared. The thought of His marvellous form, which stole the heart of sages, filled the mother with joy. His body was dark as a cloud, the delight of all eyes; in His four arms He bore His characteristic emblems (a conch-shell, a discus, a club and a lotus). Adorned with jewels and a garland of sylvan flowers and endowed with large eyes, the Slayer of the demon Khara was an ocean of beauty. Joining both her palms the mother said, \"O infinite Lord, how can I praise You! The Vedas as well as the Puranas declare You as transcending Maya, beyond attributes, above knowledge and beyond all measure. He who is sung by the Vedas and holy men as an ocean of mercy and bliss and the repository of all virtues, the same Lord of Laksmi, the lover of His devotees, has revealed Himself for my good. The Vedas proclaim that every pore of Your body contains multitudes of universes brought forth by Maya. That such a Lord stayed in my womb-this amusing story staggers the mind of even men of wisdom.\" When the revelation came upon the mother, the Lord smiled; He would perform many a sportive act. Therefore He exhorted her by telling her the charming account of her previous birth so that she might love Him as her own child. The mother's mind was changed; she spoke again, \"Give up this superhuman form and indulge in childish sports, which are so dear to a mother's heart; the joy that comes from such sports is unequalled in everyway.\" Hearing these words the all-wise Lord of immortals became an infant and began to cry. Those who sing this lay (says Tulasidasa) attain to the abode of Sri Hari and never fall into the well of mundane existence."

Clouds of incense represented the dusk; and handfuls of red powder tossed up and wafted in the air represented the redish light of sunset. The hosts of jewels that gleamed on house tops looked like so many stars; while the round pinnacle on the top of the royal palace corresponded to the beautiful moon. The murmuring sound of the chanting of Veda in the palace resembled the chirping of birds appropriate to the occasion. Gazing upon this spectacle the sun for got himself; a whole month passed without his knowing it."

From his earliest days Laksmana came to look upon Sri Rama as his benefactor and master and conceived devotion to His feet. The love that existed between the two half-brothers, Bharata and Satrughna, was as glorious as that which obtains between a master and his servant. As the mothers gazed on the beauty of the two lovely pairs, one of whom was dark, the other fair, they would break a blade of grass in order to avert the evil eye. Although all the four brothers were embodiments of amiability, beauty and goodness, yet Sri Rama was an ocean of bliss par excellence. In His heart shone the moon of grace and His captivating smile represented its rays. Now on her lap and now in the beautiful cradle, the mother fondled Him calling Him her own darling."

            "His dark form, which resembles a blue lotus and a heavy rain-cloud, possessed the beauty of millions of Cupids. The nails glistened on His red lotus-like feet as if pearls had been set on the petals of a rosy lotus. Marks of a thunderbolt, a flag and a goad shone on His soles and the tinkling of His anklets enraptured the heart of sages. A string of tiny bells girdled His waist and there were threefolds in His belly; the depth of His navel is known to him alone who has perceived it. His long arms were adorned with a number of ornaments and the tiger's claw hanging on His breast possessed an exquisite beauty. The elegance of the necklace of gems with a diamond at the lowest end and the print of the Brahmana's foot* fascinated one's mind. His neck resembled a conch-shell in its spiral shape and the chin looked most beautiful; while His face flushed with the beauty of countless Cupids. Pairs of small teeth were veiled by rosy lips and His beautiful nose and the sectarian mark on His brow defied description. With charming ears and most lovely cheeks, His sweet lisping prattle was most delightful to hear. The smooth and curly hair that had never been trimmed since His very birth had been beautifully dressed in manifold ways by the mother. A yellow frock covered His body and His crawling on knees and hands was most pleasing to me. The elegance of His form was something which even the Vedas and Sesa (the serpent-god) could not describe; it is known to him alone who has beheld it even in a dream."

On the other hand, no one can liberate from the bondage of worldly existence him who is averse to the Lord of Raghus, however much he may struggle.Even that Maya which has held under her sway all living beings, both animate and inanimate, trembles before the Lord, who makes her dance to the play of His eye-brows. Leaving such a lord, tell me, whom should we adore? The Lord of Raghus will compassionate those who betake themselves to Him in thought, word and deed, giving up all cleverness. In this way the Lord sported as a child, to the delight of all the people of the city. The mother would now dandle Him in her arms, and now put Him down and rock Him in the cradle."

Frightened at this, the mother went to her boy and found Him asleep in the nursery. Coming back once more to the temple she still saw the boy there. She now trembled with fear and her mind found no rest. She saw two boys, one in the temple and the other in the nursery. She said to herself, \"Is it my mental illusion or some other unusual phenomenon?\" When Sri Rama saw His mother perplexed, the Lord gently smiled."

The mother also beheld the embodied soul, who is made to dance by Maya, and even so the spirit of devotion, which liberates the soul. The hair on the mother's body bristled and she stood speechless. Closing her eyes she bowed her head at the Lord's feet. Seeing the mother struck with wonder the Slayer of Khara assumed the form of a child again.

The preceptor then came and performed the ceremony of tonsure; and the Brahmanas received handsome presents for officiating at the same. All the four noble princes moved about indulging in numerous plays, which were most delightful to look at. The Lord, who cannot be comprehended through mind, speech or action, sported in the courtyard of Dasaratha. When the king, while at dinner, called Him, He would not turn up, loth as he was to leave the company of His playmates. When Kausalya went to call Him, the Lord would run away toddling. He whom the Vedas declare in negative terms and whose end even Siva could not find, the mother ran to catch Him by force. With His body besmirched all over with dust, He came and the king smilingly took Him in his arms."

Those whose mind does not take delight in these have been deprived by Providence of a great good fortune. When all the four brothers attained of boyhood, the preceptor as well as their parents invested them with the sacred thread. The Lord of Raghus then proceeded to His preceptor's residence for study and in a short time mastered all the branches of knowledge. What a great fun that Sri Hari, whose natural breath stands crystallized in the form of the four Vedas, should go to school. Proficient in learning and perfect in politeness, virtues and decorum, they played all the games imitating the role of a king. With an arrow and bow in the hands of each they appeared most charming; their beauty enraptured the whole creation, both animate and inanimate. Through whichever street the four brothers passed in pursuit of their sport, all the men and women there stood motionless on perceiving them."

He would deliberately kill only holy game and brought and showed the daily bag to the king. The beasts that were killed by Sri Rama's shaft went straight to heaven after death. He took His meals with His younger brothers and companions and obeyed the orders of His parents. He would always contrive means to delight the people of the city. He would listen to the Vedas and Puranas with rapt attention and would Himself expound the truths contained therein to His younger brothers. Rising at break of day the Lord of Raghus would bow His head to His parents and preceptor and, obtaining their permission, busied Himself with the affairs of the city. The king was glad at heart to see His noble acts."

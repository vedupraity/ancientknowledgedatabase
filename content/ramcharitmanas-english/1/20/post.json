Everyday brought a new delight to the house of Himcala, whose glory was sung even by great gods like Brahm (the Creator). Receiving all the news Nrada eagerly went to the house of Himcala. The king of mountains (the presiding deity of the Himlayas), received him with great honour; washing the sages feet he led him to a beautiful seat. He bowed his head at the sages feet alongwith his wife and had his whole mansion sprinkled with the water hallowed by his feet. Himcala extolled his own good luck and, summoning his daughter, placed her at the sages feet.(1-4)"

The difference between an individual soul and God should be similarly explained. Sambhu is all-powerful by nature; for He is no other than God Himself. Hence matrimony with Him will prove auspicious in everyway. The great Lord Siva is certainly difficult to propitiate; but He is quickly pleased when penance is undergone. If your daughter practises austerity, the Slayer of the demon Tripura, Siva, can even erase the lines of Fate. Even though there may be many a suitor in the world, there is no match for her except Siva. He is the bestower of boons, the dispeller of the agony of the suppliant, an ocean of benevolence and the delight of His devotee. Without propitiating Siva the object of ones desire cannot be attained through millions of Yogic practices and Japa (repetitions of a mystic formula). (1-4)"

When Sri Rama saw the selfdiscipline and affection of Sarkara and the indelible stamp of devotion on His heart, the merciful Lord, who fully recognizes services rendered to Him, and is a mine of beauty and amiability and an embodiment of great splendour, appeared before Sarkara and extolled Him in ways more than one. Who else than You can accomplish such a vow? He said, Sri Rama admonished Him in many ways and told Him of the birth of Parvati. The Lord in His infinite compassion narrated at full length the most pious doings of Girij. (1-4)"

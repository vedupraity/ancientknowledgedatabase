The gods made obeisance and rained down flowers; while the sages uttered their benedictions, which were the source of all blessings. The songs that the ladies sang, combined with the sound of kettledrums, produced a loud symphony; men and women both were lost in love and rejoicing. In this manner Sītā entered the pavilion, while great sages recited propitiatory texts in great joy. The two family preceptors (Vasistha and Satananda) performed all the religious rites and ceremonies and observed the family customs."

The sounds of singing and kettledrums and shouts of victory in the heavens as well as in the city overflowed as it were in all direction . The lotus-feet that ever sparkle in the lake of Śiva's bosom, by thinking of which even for once the mind gets purified and all the impurities of the Kali age are driven away, by whose touch the sage Gautama's wife, who was full of sin, attained salvation, whose nectar in the form of the river Gaṅgā adorns Śambhu's head and is declared by the gods as the holiest of the holy, and by resorting to which with their bee-like minds sages and mystics attain the goal of their liking, it is those very feet that the most lucky Janaka washed amidst shouts of victory from all corners. Joining the palms of the Bride and the Bridegroom, both the family priests recited the genealogy of the two families; and perceiving that the Bridegroom had accepted the Bride's hand, Brahma and the other divinities as well as men and sages were filled with delight. As the king and queen gazed on the Bridegroom, who was the very fountain of joy, the hair on their body stood erect, while their heart was filled with rapture. And having gone through all the rites sanctioned either by the Vedas or by family usage, the glorious King Janaka gave his Daughter to the Bridegroom. As Himavān gave away Girijā to the great Lord Śiva, and the deity presiding over seas bestowed Śrī on Hari, so did Janaka give Sītā to Rāma and thereby earned fair renown of an unprecedented character. King Videha (Janaka) was unable to make any supplication, since that Prince (Śrī Rāma) of swarthy complexion had justified his name (Videha) by making him forget everything about his body. When oblations had been offered to the sacred fire with due rite, the ends of garments of the Bride and the Bridegroom were tied together (as a token of their indissoluble union) and the couple began to circumambulate the fire (in order to show that the two had been united in the presence of the fire-god as a witness)."

            "The Bride and Bridegroom performed the circumambulation with charming paces; while all present feasted their admiring gaze on the spectacle. The lovely couple was beyond description; whatever comparison might be suggested would fall short of the reality. Lovely images of Rāma and Sītā were reflected on the pillars of jewels and shone as if Love and his consort, Rati, witnessed Śrī Rāma's matchless wedding appearing in numerous forms. Their curiosity and bashfulness were equally great; that is why they revealed themselves and went out of sight again and again. All the spectators were enraptured; like Janaka they forgot all about themselves. Joyously the sages bade the Bride and Bridegroom pace round the fire and accomplished all the rites including the ceremonial gifts, Śrī Rāma applied the vermilion to Sītā's forehead, a sight the charm of which was altogether beyond description. It seemed as if with a lotus surcharged with reddish pollen a serpent thirsting for nectar decorated the moon. Then Vasistha gave the direction and the Bride and Bridegroom sat together on the same seat."

Joy thrilled along his veins again and again as he perceived the wish-yielding tree of his meritorious deeds bear new fruits. There was rejoicing all over the universe; everyone proclaimed that Śrī Rāma's wedding had been accomplished . With one tongue how could anyone describe in full the joy which knew no bounds? Then, receiving Vasistha's order, Janaka sent for the other three princesses, Mandavi, Srutakirti and Urmila, each clad in a bride's attire. The eldest daughter of his younger brother Kusaketu, who was an embodiment of goodness, virtue, joy and beauty, he gave in marriage to Bharata after performing every rite with love. Jānakī's younger sister (Urmila), whom he knew to be the crest-jewel of charming girls, Janaka gave in marriage to lakṣmaṇa with all honour. Finally the bright-eyed and fair-faced princess Srutakirti, who was a mine of all virtues and was well-known for her beauty and amiability, the king gave to Ripusudana. When each pair of bride and bridegroom saw that they were wellmatched with each others*, they felt shy, but rejoiced in their heart of hearts; everyone joyfully applauded the beauty of each pair, while the gods rained down flowers. All the lovely brides with their handsome bridegrooms shone forth in the same pavilion as though the four states of consciousness (viz., waking, dream, sound sleep and absorption into Brahma) with the phase of the soul presiding over each gleamed all at once of the heart of an individual."

There were a number of shawls, linen and silk of various colours and designs and of immense value, elephants, chariots, horses, men-servants and maid-servants and cows adorned with ornaments and vying with the cow of plenty and many other things which were more than one could count and defied description. They alone who saw the dowry could have some idea of it; even the guardians of the different realms regarded it with envy. The king of Ayodhyā gladly accepted it all and gave to the beggars whatever they liked; only that which was left was taken to the lodgings of the bridegroom's party. Then with joined palms Janaka honoured the whole bridegroom's party and spoke in gentle tones."

Bowing his head and invoking the gods he addressed them all with joined palms, \"Gods and holy men seek one's love alone; can the ocean be propitiated by offering as much water as can be held within one's palms?\" Again, with joined palms Janaka and his younger brother (Kusaketu) submitted to the King of Kosala in winning words full of affection, courtesy and sincerity, \"By our connection with you, O king, we have now been exalted in every respect; alongwith this kingdom and all that we possess pray look upon us both as your slaves purchased without any consideration. Taking these girls as your hand-maidens foster them with your unremitting kindness. Pardon me my offence; it was too presumptuous on my part to have called you here.\" The ornament of the solar race, King Daśaratha, in his turn flooded the bride's father with all kinds of honour. The courtesy they showed to each other was past all telling; for their hearts overflowed with love. Hosts of gods rained down flowers and King Daśaratha proceeded to the palace where he and his party had been lodged amidst the crash of kettledrums, shouts of victory and the chanting of Vedic texts. There was much rejoicing both in the heavens and in the city. Then, receiving orders from the chief of sages, Vasistha, the lovely companions of the brides conducted them alongwith the bridegrooms to the apartment where the guardian deities of the family had been installed for worship during the wedding days."

The girdle round His waist together with the sweet-sounding small bells was soul-enchanting; His long arms were adorned with beautiful ornaments. The yellow sacred thread greatly enhanced His charm; while the ring on His finger would ravish all hearts. Beautified with all sorts of wedding adornments He looked most charming; His broad chest was adorned with appropriate ornaments. He had a yellow scarf with fringes of pearls and gems slung partly under His right armpit and partly across His left shoulder. He had a pair of lotus-like eyes and beautiful pendants dangling from the lobes of his ears; while His countenance was a storehouse of all comeliness. He had lovely eyebrows and a charming nose; while the sacred mark on His forehead was an abode of loveliness. And His head was adorned with a beautiful wedding crown which had auspicious pearls and gems strung together and woven into it."

            "Precious gems had been strung together and woven into the lovely wedding crown and each of His limbs ravished the heart. At the sight of the bridegroom (Śrī Rāma) the women of the city as well as pretty celestial ladies all tore blades of grass (in order to avert the evil eye). After scattering about Him gems, raiment and ornaments they waved lights around Him and sang festal songs. The gods rained down flowers; while bards, panegyrists and rhapsodists uttered His praises. Married women, whose husbands were alive, happily brought the brides and bridegrooms to the apartment reserved for the tutelary deities, and with festal songs they most lovingly began to perform customary rites. Goddess Gaurī Herself taught Rāma how to offer a morsel of food to Sītā; while Śāradā urged Sītā to do likewise with Rāma. The whole gynaeceum was absorbed in the delight of merry-making; everyone enjoyed the fruit of her birth. In the gems on Her hand Jānakī saw the reflection of Śrī Rāma, the repository of beauty; hence She dared not move Her arm or eyes for fear of losing sight of Him. The rapture and love that characterized the gaiety and mirth of the occasion surpassed all telling; Sītā's companions alone knew them. They escorted all the four charming couples to the palace assigned to King Daśaratha and his party. At that moment blessings might be heard on all sides and there was great exultation in the city as well as in the heavens. Everyone exclaimed with a delighted heart, \"Long live the four lovely couples!\" Great Yogīs, Siddhas, eminent sages and divinities sounded their kettledrums on beholding the Lord; and raining down flowers and crying \"Victory, victory, victory\" they gladly returned, each to his own realm"

Similarly he washed with his own hands the feet of the other three brothers also, treating them on a par with Śrī Rāma. King Janaka assigned an appropriarte seat to each guest and sent for all the cooks (for service). Leaves joined together so as to serve for plates were set before the guests with due reverence-leaves which were made of precious stones and had been joined with gold pins."

Expert cooks then began to serve a variety of seasoned articles which were too numerous to be named.

Similarly there were seasoned dishes of various kinds, having six different flavours, each flavour being exhibited in numberless varieties. As the dinner was in progress, women railed in melodious strains at men and women both, mentioning each by name. Even raillery at an opportune time is agreeable and welcome; King Daśaratha and his whole party felt amused to hear it. In this way the whole party dined and in the end they were all reverently supplied with water to rinse their mouth with."

The sages Kausika and Satananda then called on King Videha and advised him saying, \"Now you must let Desaratha go, even though you may not be able to part with him out of love.\" \"Very well, my lord\", replied the king, and sent for his ministers, who came and bowed their heads saying, \"May you be victorious, may you live long!\""

After rubbing the body of Śrī Rāma and His brothers with cosmetics they were given a bath and were most lovingly entertained with dishes containing the six flavours. Finding it a suitable opportunity Śrī Rāma spoke in accents full of amiability, affection and modesty. \"Our royal father intends leaving for Ayodhyā, and has sent us here to take leave of you. Therefore, mothers, grant us permission with a cheerful mind and ever regard us with affection as your own children.\" The ladies of the gynaeceum were distressed to hear these words; the mothers-in-law were too overwhelmed with emotion to speak a word. They clasped all the princesses to their bosom and while giving them to their lords made humble submission to them"

While seeking her permission with joined palms He made obeisance to her again and again. Having received her blessings the Lord of Raghus bowed His head once more and then departed with His brothers. Treasuring up in their heart Śrī Rāma's lovely and beautiful image all the queens were overcome with emotion. Then, recovering themselves, they called their daughters and embraced them again and again. They escorted them to some distance and then embraced them once more; the love on both sides swelled to a considerable extent. While meeting their daughters again and again they were parted by the companions of the princesses even as a cow who has just brought forth a calf may be parted from the latter."

When birds and beasts were distressed in this way, how can one depict the feelings of the human breast. Then came King Janaka with his younger brother (Kusadhvaja); due to excess of emotion tears rushed to his eyes. Although he was reputed to be a man of supreme dispassion, his strength of mind took leave of him the moment he gazed on Sītā. The king clasped Jānakī to his bosom and the great embankment of wisdom toppled down. All his wise counsellors admonished him; and realizing that it was no occasion for wailing, the king recovered himself. Again and again he pressed his daughters to his bosom and ordered beautiful and well-equipped palanquins to be brought."

Glorifying the king again and again they all returned with Śrī Rāma in their heart. The Lord of Ayodhyā importuned King Janaka over and over again; but out of affection for his relative the latter would not turn back. Once more King Daśaratha addressed him in polite terms, \"I beg you to turn back, O king; you have already advanced too far.\" At last King Daśaratha got down from his chariot and remained standing, while his eyes overflowed with torrents of love. Then spoke King Videha with joined palms and in accents imbued with the nectar of love, \"How and in what words should I make my supplication to you? You have conferred such high honour on me, O great king.\""

The joy and the bright renown which the regional lords of the universe long to have, but feel too diffident to expect-such a joy and glory has been brought within my reach; and all achievements follow on seeing you.\" In these words King Janaka made humble submission to Viśvāmitra, bowing his head again and again, and returned after receiving his blessings. The bridegrooms' party started on its return journey to the sound of kettledrums; all the sections, both big and small, were transported with joy. Men and women of the villages, as they gazed on Śrī Rāma, felt gratified on realizing the object of their eyes."

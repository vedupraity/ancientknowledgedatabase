            "The very sight and touch of the Sarayu, a dip into its waters or a draught from it cleanses one's sins-so declare the Vedas and Puranas. Even Sarada, the goddess of learning, with Her pure intelligence cannot describe the infinite glory of this most sacred river. The beautiful town of Ayodhya grants an abode in Sri Rama's heaven; it is celebrated through all the worlds and is the holiest of the holy. There are countless living beings in this world belonging to the four species (viz., viviparous, oviparous, sweat-born and those shooting from the earth); whoever of these shed their mortal coil in Ayodhya are never born again. Knowing the town to be charming in everyway, a bestower of all forms of success and a storehouse of blessings, I commenced writing this sacred story there. The impulses of lust, arrogance and hypocrisy positively disappear from the mind of those who hear it. One derives solace by hearing its very name, Ramacaritamanasa (the Manasa lake of Sri Rama's exploits). The elephant of our mind, which is being scorched by the wild fire of sensuous enjoyments, is sure to get relief should it drop into this lake. The holy and beautiful Ramacaritamanasa is the delight of sages; it was conceived by Sambhu (Lord Siva). It puts down the three kinds of error, sorrow and indigence* and uproots all evil practices and impurities of the Kali age. Having conceived it, the great Lord Siva treasured it in His mind till, when a favourable opportunity presented itself, He communicated it to His consort, Siva (Parvati). Therefore, after due consideration Lord Hara joyously gave it the excellent title of Ramacaritamanasa†. I repeat the same delightful and charming story; hear it reverently and attentively, O noble souls. (1-7)"

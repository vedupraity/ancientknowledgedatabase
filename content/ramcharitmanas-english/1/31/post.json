He felt as if a gem had dropped from a loosened knot in the end of his garment. The attendants of Hara then smilingly said, \"Just look at your face in a mirror.\" Uttering these words both ran away in great alarm and the sage looked at his reflection in water. His fury knew no bounds when he beheld his form; and he pronounced a terrible curse on the attendants of Śiva"

He was accompanied by Goddess Rāma and the princess referred to above. The lord of immortals spoke in gentle tones, \"To what destination, holy sir, are you betaking yourself like one distracted?\" As soon as he heard these words Nārada was filled with rage. Dominated as he was by Māyā, there was no reason left in him. He said, \"You cannot bear to look upon the good fortune of others. You are richly endowed with jealousy and fraud. While churning the ocean You drove Rudra mad and inciting Him through the gods You made Him quaff the poison.\""

Infinite is Śrī Hari and infinite are His stories; each saint sings and hears them in divergent ways. The lovely sports of Rāmacandra cannot be sung even in crores of Kalpas.This episode, O Bhavānī, has been narrated by me in order to show that even enlightened sages are deluded by Śrī Hari's Māyā. The Lord is sportive and a friend of the suppliant; He is easy to serve and rids one of all sorrows."

I shall relate at length the marvellous story connected with it. The Lord whom you saw roaming in the forest with His brother (Lakṣmaṇa) in the garb of hermits, and whose doings drove you mad in the form of Sati to such an extent that the shadow of that madness haunts you even to this day-hear His exploits, which serve as a cure for the disease of delusion. The sportive deeds that were performed by the Lord in that birth, I shall relate them all to the best of My talents. Hearing Śaṅkara's words, O Bharadvāja, Umā blushed and smiled with love. Śiva (who has a bull emblazoned on His standard) then began to relate the cause of the Lord's descent on that particular occasion."

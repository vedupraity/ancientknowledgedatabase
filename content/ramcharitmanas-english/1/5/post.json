The good as well as the vile, all have been brought into being by the Creator; it is the Vedas that have differentiated them by reckoning the merits of the former class and the demerits of the other. The Vedas, the Itihāsas (such as the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata) and the Purāṇas unanimously declare that the creation of Brahmā (the Creator) is an intermixture of good and evil. It is characterized by pairs of opposites such as pain and pleasure, sin and merit, day and night, the good and the wicked, good birth and vile birth, demons and gods, the high and the low, nectar and poison, a happy life and death, Māyā and Brahma, i.e., Matter and Spirit, the soul and God (the Lord of the universe), plenty and poverty, the pauper and the king, the sacred Kaśī or Vārāṇasī and Magadha or North Bihar (the accursed land), the holy Gaṅgā the river of the celestials- and the unholy Karmanāśā* (in Bihar), the desert land of Māravāra (Western Rājapũtānā and Sindha) and the rich soil of Mālavā, the Brahmana - who is a veritable god on earth - and the barbarian who feeds on the cow, heaven and hell, attachment and dispassion.

By force of the spirit of the times, old habits and past Karma even the good deviate from goodness under the influence of Māyā. But just as servants of Śrī Hari rectify that error and, eradicating sorrow and weakness, bring untarnished glory to them, even so the wicked occasionally perform a noble deed due to their good association, although their evil nature, which is unchangeable, cannot be obliterated. Even those who are impostors are respected on account of their garb, as the world is taken in by their attractive appearance. But they are eventually exposed, and cannot keep up their false appearance till the end, as was the case with Kālanemi*, Rāvaṇa† and Rāhu.‡ The good are honoured notwithstanding their mean appearance, even as Jāmbavān (a general of Sugrriva's army, who was endowed with the form of a bear and possessed miraculous strength) and Hanumān (the monkey-god) won honour in this world. Bad association is harmful, while good company is an asset in itself: this is true in the world as well as in the eyes of the Vedas, and is known to all.Through contact with the wind dust ascends to the sky, while it is assimilated with mud when united with low-lying waters. Parrots and Mainās nurtured in the house of the virtuous and the wicked repeat the name of Rāma and pour a volley of abuses respectively. Smoke coming in contact with an evil (earthy)§ substance turns into soot; the same is used as a material for copying the Purāṇas with when converted into beautiful ink. Again, in conjunction with water, fire and air it is transformed into a cloud and brings life to the world."

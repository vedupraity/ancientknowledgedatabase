A king named Satyaketu ruled there. He was a champion of virtue, a storehouse of political wisdom, dignified, glorious, amiable and powerful. He had two gallant sons, who were repositories of all virtues and most staunch in battle. The elder of the two and the heir to the throne was named Pratapabhanu. The other was known by the name of Arimardana, who was unequalled in strength of arm and steady in battle. There was perfect unity between the two brothers and the affection each bore to the other was free from all blemish and guile. To the elder son the king resigned the throne and withdrew himself into the forest for the sake of devotion to Sri Hari."

It had numberless excellent warriors all of whom fought fearlessly in battle. The king rejoiced to see his army and there was a tumultuous sound of kettledrums. He collected a special force for the conquest of the world, and availing himself of an auspicious day marched forth with beat of drums. A number of battles were fought here and there and all hostile kings were brought to their knees by superior might. By the strength of his arm be reduced all the seven sections of the terrestrial region and let the princes go on payment of tribute.

The beast rushed on, now hiding and now emerging into view; while the king in much excitement followed closely on its track. The boar went afar into a dense thicket, which was impenetrable by horse or elephant. Even though the king was all by himself and was faced with untold hardships in the forest, still he would not abandon the chase. Seeing the king so determined, the boar slunk away into a deep mountain-cave. When the king perceived that there was no access to the cave, he had to return much disappointed; and, what was worse, he lost his track in the great forest"

In that hermitage dwelt, in the disguise of a hermit, a monarch who had been despoiled of his kingdom by Pratapabhanu and who had run away from the field of battle deserting his army. Knowing that the time was propitious for Pratapabhanu and most unfavourable to his own self, he felt much disgusted at heart and refused to return home; and he was too proud to come to terms with the victor. Suppressing the anger in his own heart the ex-king lived in the forest like a pauper in the garb of an anchorite. It was to him that king Pratapabhanu went and he for his part immediately recognized that the newcomer was no other than Pratapabhanu. Overcome by thirst, the latter, however, could not recognize the ex-king. Perceiving his holy garb Pratapabhanu took him to be a great sage and, getting down from his horse, made obeisance to him. The king was, however, too astute to disclose his name."

Having discussed topics of Karma (action) and Dharma (duty) and told many legends bearing on them he discoursed on dispassion and knowledge. And he further related at length countless marvellous stories connected with the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe. Hearing all this the king completely yielded to the influence of the hermit and then proceeded to tell him his real name. Said the hermit, \"O king, I know you.

            "The hermit-king was delighted to see his ally and rose to meet him. The meeting gave him much satisfaction and he related the whole story to his friend. The demon too was glad and said, \"Listen, O king: since you have followed my advice, take the enemy as subdued. Cease to worry now and lay yourself to rest. God has effected a cure without the use of a medicine, I will sweep away the enemy root and branch and see you on the fourth day.\" Fully reassuring the hermit-king, the arch-impostor, who was highly irascible, departed. In an instant he conveyed Pratapabhanu to his palace, horse and all. Putting the king to bed beside his queen, he tied up the horse in the stall in the proper way."

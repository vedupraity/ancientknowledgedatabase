From the attitude of Sarkara, however, She judged that the Lord had abandoned Her, and felt disturbed in Her heart. Conscious of Her guilt She could not utter a word of protest; but all the while Her heart smouldered like a furnace. Perceiving the sad look of Sats, Siva (who has a bull emblazoned on His standard) narrated beautiful stories in order to divert Her mind. Relating various legends while on His way, the Lord of the universe, Siva, reached Kailsa. Then, recalling His vow, Sambhu sat down there under a banyan tree in the Yogic pose known as Padmsana (the pose of a lotus). Sarkara communed with His own Self and passed into an unbroken and indefinitely long Samdhi (trance). (1-4)"

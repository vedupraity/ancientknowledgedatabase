The sage worshipped Him knowing Him to be the universal lord. The great sage narrated at length the story of Rma and Lord Mahesa listened to it with extreme delight. The sage then inquired about Devotion to Hari and Sambhu discoursed on it finding in the sage a fit recipient. Thus narrating and hearing the tale of Sri Ramas virtues, the Lord of Kailsa (Siva) spent some days there. Finally, asking leave of the sage, the Slayer of the demon Tripura, Sarkara, proceeded to His home (Mount Kailsa) with Daksas daughter (Sats). During those very days, with a view to relieving the burden of the earth, Sri Hari had descended in the line of king Raghu. Renouncing His right to the Throne at the word of His father (Dasaratha), the immortal Lord was wandering in the Dandaka forest in the garb of an ascetic. (1-4)"

Having killed the antelope Sri Hari returned with His brother (Laksmana) ; and His eyes were filled with tears when He saw the empty hermitage.

            "Having realized the greatness of the Hero of Raghus race, Sats in Her awe concealed the truth from Siva. I made no test my Lord; I made obeisance just like You. What You said cannot be untrue; I am fully convinced in my heart. Lord Sarkara then looked within by contemplation and came to know all that Sats had done. Again, He bowed His head to the delusive power of Sri Rama, that had prompted Sats to tell a lie. What has been preordained by the will of Sri Hari must have its way, the all-wise Sambhu thought within Himself. Sats had assumed the disguise of Sst: this made Siva much disconsolate at heart. If I continue to love Sats as heretofore, the cult of Devotion will disappear and it will be indecorous on My part to do so. (1-4)"

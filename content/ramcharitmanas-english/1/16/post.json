The sage worshipped Him knowing Him to be the universal lord. The great sage narrated at length the story of Rāma and Lord Mahesa listened to it with extreme delight. The sage then inquired about Devotion to Hari and Śambhu discoursed on it finding in the sage a fit recipient. Thus narrating and hearing the tale of Śrī Rāma's virtues, the Lord of Kailāsa (Śiva) spent some days there. Finally, asking leave of the sage, the Slayer of the demon Tripura, Śaṅkara, proceeded to His home (Mount Kailāsa) with Dakṣa's daughter (Satī). During those very days, with a view to relieving the burden of the earth, Śrī Hari had descended in the line of king Raghu. Renouncing His right to the Throne at the word of His father (Daśaratha), the immortal Lord was wandering in the Daṇḍaka forest in the garb of an ascetic. (1-4)"

Meanwhile the vile Rāvaṇa (who had no less than ten heads) took with him the demon Mārīca, who forthwith assumed the illusory form of a deer. The fool (Rāvaṇa) carried off king Videha's daughter (Sītā) by fraud; the Lord's real might was not known to him. Having killed the antelope Śrī Hari returned with His brother (Lakṣmaṇa) ; and His eyes were filled with tears when He saw the empty hermitage. The Lord of Raghus felt distressed at the loss like a mortal man, and the two brothers roamed about in the woods in search of Her. He who knows neither union nor separation showed unmistakable signs of grief born of separation. (1-4)"

On this side Śiva came to the conclusion that mischief was in store for Dakṣa's daughter (Satī). \"When her doubt did not yield even to My assurances,\" He said to Himself, \"it seems the stars are unpropitious to her and no good-will come out of it. After all, whatever Śrī Rāma has willed must come to pass; why should one add to the complication by indulging in further speculation?\" So saying, Lord Śiva began to mutter the name of Śrī Hari; while Satī proceeded to the spot where the all-blissful Lord (Śrī Rāma) was.

            "Having realized the greatness of the Hero of Raghu's race, Satī in Her awe concealed the truth from Śiva. \"I made no test my Lord; I made obeisance just like You. What You said cannot be untrue; I am fully convinced in my heart.\" Lord Śaṅkara then looked within by contemplation and came to know all that Satī had done. Again, He bowed His head to the delusive power of Śrī Rāma, that had prompted Satī to tell a lie. What has been preordained by the will of Śrī Hari must have its way, the all-wise Śambhu thought within Himself. Satī had assumed the disguise of Sītā: this made Śiva much disconsolate at heart. \"If I continue to love Satī as heretofore, the cult of Devotion will disappear and it will be indecorous on My part to do so.\" (1-4)"

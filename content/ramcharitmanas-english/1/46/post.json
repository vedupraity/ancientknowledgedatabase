Glory to You, who gaze on the countenance of the great Lord Śiva as a Cakora bird on the moon. Glory to You, O Mother of the elephant-headed Gaṇeśa and the six-faced Kartikeya and mother of the universe with limbs shining as lightning.

And just as lotuses and bees and the Cakravaka and various other birds rejoice over the termination of night, even so, my lord, all Your devotees will be glad when the bow is broken. Lo, the sun is up and the darkness has automatically disappeared; the stars have vanished out of sight and light flashes upon the world. Under pretence of its rising, O Lord of Raghus, the sun has demonstrated to all the princes the glory of my lord (Yourself). It is in order to reveal the might of Your arms that the process of breaking the bow has been set into operation.\" The Lord smiled at these remarks of His brother. He who is pure by His very nature then performed the daily acts of purification and bathed, and after finishing the daily routine of prayer etc., called on His Guru and the two brothers bowed their graceful heads at his lotus feet. Meanwhile King Janaka summoned his preceptor Satananda and sent him at once to the sage Kausika. Satananda communicated to Viśvāmitra Janaka's humble submission and Viśvāmitra gladly sent for the two brothers."

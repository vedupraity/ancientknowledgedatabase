He joined his five arrows to his bow of flowers, and casting an angry look drew the string home to his very ears. He discharged the five sharp arrows, which smote the breast of Śiva. The trance was now broken and Śambhu awoke. The Lord's mind was much agitated. Opening His eyes He looked all round. When He saw Cupid hiding behind mango leaves, He flew into a rage, which made all the three spheres tremble. Śiva then uncovered His third eye; the moment He looked at the god of love the latter was reduced to ashes. A loud wail went up through the universe. The gods were alarmed, while the domons were gratified. The thought of (loss of) sense-delights made the voluptuary sad; while the striving Yogss were relieved of a thorn as it were. (1-4)"

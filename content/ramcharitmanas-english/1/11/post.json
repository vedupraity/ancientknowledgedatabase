It is the same as Brahmā (the creative aspect of God), Viṣṇu (His preservative aspect) and Śiva (His disintegrating aspect), and the vital breath of the Vedas; It is attributeless, peerless and a mine of virtues. It is the great spell which Lord Maheśvara mutters and which, when imparted by Him at Kāśī (the modern Vārāṇasī) leads to emancipation‡. Its glory is known to Lord Gaṇeśa, who is worshipped before all others as a concession to the Name§. The oldest poet (Vālmīki) is acquainted with the glory of the Name, inasmuch as he attained to purity by repeating It in the reverse order#. Hearing the verdict of Lord Śiva that the name is as good as a thousand other names of God, Goddess Bhavānī (Pārvatī) dined with Her consort after uttering It only once%. Noticing such partiality of Her heart for the Name, Hara (Lord Śiva) made that lady, who was the ornament of Her sex, the ornament of His own person (i.e., made Her a part of His own being by assigning to Her the left half of His body). Śiva knows full well the power of the Name, due to which deadly poison served the purpose of nectar to Him.(1-4)"

He told them that they should race round the world and that whoever finished the round quickest of all would be accounted the highest. Gaṇeśa, who rode on no better animal than a rat, naturally lagged behind. He met on the way the celestial sage Nārada, who advised him to scratch the word 'Rāma' on the ground and pace round It, as the word comprised in Itself the entire creation. Gaṇeśa did accordingly and was naturally the first to finish the round of the universe. Brahmā appreciated this act of Gaṇeśa and conceded his title to precedence over all the other gods. Since then Gaṇeśa has uninterruptedly enjoyed the right of being worshipped first of all.",
            "**%** We are told in the Padmapurāṇa how Bhagavān Śaṅkara once invited His consort to join Him in His dinner. Goddess Pārvatī, however, declind on the ground that She had not yet recited the Viṣṇu-Sahasranāma, which She must before Her breakfast. Bhagavān Śaṅkara asked Her to repeat the name of Rāma instead, as a single utterance of the Name was as good as reciting a thousand other names of the Lord. Pārvatī did accordingly and forthwith joined Her lord in dinner."

Name and form are the two attributes of God; both of them are ineffable and beginningless and can be rightly understood only by means of good intelligence. It is presumptuous on one's part to declare as to which is superior or inferior. Hearing the distinctive merits of both, pious souls will judge for themselves. Forms are found to be subordinate to the name; without the name you cannot come to the knowledge of a form. Typical forms cannot be identified, even if they be in your hand, without knowing their name. And if the name is remembered even without seeing the form, the latter flashes on the mind with a special liking for it. The mystery of name and form is a tale which cannot be told; though delightful to comprehend, it cannot be described in words. Between the unqualified Absolute and qualified Divinity, the Name is a good intermediary; it is a clever interpreter revealing the truth of both.(1-4)"

Even those (seekers of Truth) who aspire to know the mysterious ways of Providence are able to comprehend them by muttering the Name. Strivers (hankering after worldly achievements) repeat the Name, absorbed in contemplation, and become accomplished, acquiring superhuman powers such as that of becoming infinitely small in size.* If devotees in distress mutter the Name, their worst calamities of the gravest type disappear and they become happy. In this world there are four kinds of devotees† of Śrī Rāma; all the four of them are virtuous, sinless and noble. All the four, clever as they are, rely upon the Name. Of these the enlightened devotee is specially dear to the Lord. The glory of the Name is supreme in all the four Yugas and all the four Vedas, particularly in the Kali age, in which there is no other means of salvation.(1-4)"

Friends should not take this as a bold assertion on the part of this servant; I record my mind's own conviction, partiality and liking. The two aspects of Brahma (God) should be recognized as akin to fire: the one (viz., the Absolute) represents fire which is latent in wood; while the other (qualified Divinity) corresponds to that which is externally visible. Though both are inaccessible by themselves, they are easily attainable through the Name; therefore I have called the Name greater than Brahma and Śrī Rāma both. Brahma (God) is one, all-pervading and imperishable; He is all truth, consciousness and a compact mass of joy. Even though such immutable Lord is present in every heart, all beings in this world are nonetheless miserable and unhappy. Through the practice of the Name preceded by Its true appraisement, however, the same Brahma reveals Itself even as the value of a jewel is revealed by its correct knowledge.(1-4)"

Again, it is by the grace of the Name alone that Siddhas (adepts), sages and Yogīs like Śuka, Sanaka and others enjoy divine raptures, Nārada realized the glory of the Name; that is why, while Śrī Hari is beloved of the world (and Hara is dear to Śrī Hari), he (Nārada) is dear to Hari and Hara (Viṣṇu and Śiva) both. It was because of his repeating the Name that the Lord showered His grace on Prahlāda, who thereby became the crest-jewel of devotees. Dhruva repeated the name of Śrī Hari with a feeling of indignation (at the harsh treatment received from his step-mother) and thereby attained a fixed and incomparable station in the heavens. It is by remembering the holy Name that Hanumān (son of the wind-god) holds Śrī Rāma under His thumb. The vile Ajāmila and even the celebrated elephant and the harlot of the legend were liberated by the power of Śrī Hari's name. I have no words to depict the glory of the Name: not even Rāma can adequately glorify it.(1-4)"

The verdict of the Vedas and the Purāṇas as well as of saints is just this; that love of Rāma (or the name 'Rāma') is the reward of all virtuous acts. In the first age, contemplation; in the second age, sacrifice; in the Dvāpara age the Lord is propitiated through worship. This age of Kali, however, is simply corrupt and the root of all impurities, where the mind of man wallows like a fish in the ocean of sin. In this terrible age the Name alone is the wish-yielding tree, the very thought of which puts an end to all the illusions of the world. The Name of Rāma is the bestower of one's desired object in this age of Kali; It is beneficent in the other world and one's father and mother in this world. In Kaliyuga neither Karma (action) nor Bhakti (devotion) nor again Jñāna (knowledge) avails; the name of Rāma is the only resort. The age of Kali is as it were the demon Kālanemi, the repository of all wiles; whereas the Name is the wise and mighty Hanumān.†(1-4)"

He whose grace is never tired of showing its good-will to others will mend my errors in everyway. Rāma a noble Lord, and a poor servant like myself! Yet, true to His own disposition, that storehouse of compassion has fostered me. In the world as well as in the Vedas we observe the following characteristic in a good master, viz., that he comes to recognize one's devotion to him as soon as he hears one's prayer. Rich or poor, rustic or urban, learned or unlettered, of good repute or bad, a good poet or a bad one, all men and women extol the king according to his or her light. And the pious, sensible, amiable and supremely compassionate ruler, who takes his descent from a ray of God, greets all with sweet words hearing their compliments and appraising their composition, devotion, supplication and conduct. Such is the way of earthly monarchs, to say nothing of the Lord of Kosala (Śrī Rāma), who is the crest-jewel of wise men. Śrī Rāma gets pleased with unalloyed love; but who is duller and more impure of mind in this world than I ?(1-6)"

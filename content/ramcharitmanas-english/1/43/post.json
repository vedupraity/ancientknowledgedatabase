My mind, which is dispassion itself in its natural form, is enraptured at their sight even as the Cakora bird is transported with joy at the sight of the moon. Therefore, Sir, I earnestly inquire of you: tell me the truth, my Lord; hide nothing from me. Deeply attached to them at their very sight, my mind has perforce renounced the joy of absorption into Brahma.\" The sage smilingly answered, \"You have spoken well, O king; your words can never be untrue. Whatever living beings there are in this world, they all love these boys.\" Śrī Rāma smiled within Himself on hearing these words. \"They are the sons of King Daśaratha, the jewel of Raghu's race; the king has sent them for my cause."

Extolling the sage and bowing his head at the latter's feet, the king escorted him to his capital, and lodged the sage in a beautiful palace which was comfortable at all times. Then, after further homage and rendering all kinds of service to him, the king took leave of the sage and returned to his own palace."

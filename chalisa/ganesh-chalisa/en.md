Riddhi-Siddhi (wives) are always in your service and Mūṣaka (mouse) is your vehicle, and is standing at your door as a gatekeeper.

##### kahau janma śubha kathā tumhārī, ati śuci pāvana maṃgalakārī .
##### eka samaya girirāja kumārī, putra hetu tapa kīnhā bhārī .. 5 ..

O Lord, it is very auspicious to tell and listen to your birth story.

Once upon a time, the daughter of the mountains i.e. Mother Pārvatī did a very difficult penance to get a son.

##### bhayo yajña jaba pūrṇa anūpā, taba pahum̐cyo tuma dhari dvija rūpā .
##### atithi jāni ke gaurī sukhārī, bahuvidhi sevā karī tumhārī .. 6 ..

When his penance was well completed, you appeared there in the form of a Brāhmaṇa.

Considering you as a guest, Mother Pārvatī welcomed and served you in many ways.

##### ati prasanna havai tuma vara dīnhā, mātu putra hita jo tapa kīnhā .
##### milahi putra tuhi, buddhi viśālā, binā garbha dhāraṇa yahi kālā .. 7 ..

Pleased with which you gave a boon to Mother Pārvatī.

You said - O mother, as a result of the austerity you have done to get a son, you will get a very intelligent child and you will get a son now without suffering.

##### gaṇanāyaka guṇa jñāna nidhānā, pūjita prathama rūpa bhagavānā .
##### asa kehi antardhāna rūpa havai, palanā para bālaka svarūpa havai .. 8 ..

Who will be called the hero of all the gods, who will determine the qualities and knowledge, and the whole world will worship him in the first form of God.

Saying this you disappeared and appeared in the form of a child in the cradle.

##### bani śiśu rudana jabahiṃ tuma ṭhānā, lakhi mukha sukha nahiṃ gaurī samānā .
##### sakala magana sukha maṃgala gāvahiṃ, nābha te surana sumana varṣāvahiṃ .. 9 ..

You started crying as soon as Mother Pārvatī picked you up, Mother Pārvatī has been looking at you with great love. Your face was very beautiful, even the happiness on a million faces could not match the happiness on the face of Mother Pārvatī.

Everyone is celebrating this moment of happiness and started dancing and singing. The Gods also started showering flowers from the sky.

##### śambhu umā bahudāna luṭāvahiṃ, sura munijana suta dekhana āvahiṃ .
##### lakhi ati ānanda maṃgala sājā, dekhana bhī āe śani rājā .. 10 ..

Lord Śaṃkara (Śiva) and Mother Pārvatī started donating in many ways. The deities and sages all came to see you.

Everyone was filled with joy. Lord Śani Dev also came to see you.

##### nija avaguṇa guni śani mana māhīṃ, bālaka dekhana cāhata nāhīṃ .
##### girijā kachu mana bheda baḍhāyo, utsava mora na śani tuhi bhāyo .. 11 ..

But he was so afraid (Śani Dev was cursed by his wife that any child he would look at with his eyes filled with love, his head would detach from the body and fly away in the sky) and did not want to see the child.

Seeing Śani Dev trying to avoid to see the child, Mother Pārvatī got angry and told Śani that you are not happy to see us celebrating the festival for our child.

##### kahata lage śani mana sakucāī, kā kariho śiśu mohi dikhāī .
##### nahiṃ viśvāsa umā ura bhayaū, śani soṃ bālaka dekhana kahayaū .. 12 ..

On this Lord Śani said - I am hesitant, what will you do by showing me the child? I'm afraid Something bad will happen.

But Mother Pārvatī did not believe on this and asked Śani to see the child.

##### padatahiṃ śani dṛga koṇa prakāśā, bālaka sira uḍai gayo akāśā .
##### girijā girī vikala havai dharaṇī, so duḥkha daśā gayo nahiṃ varaṇī .. 13 ..

As soon as Śani glanced at child, the child's head flew up in the sky.

Seeing her child headless, Mother Pārvatī fell unconscious on the ground. At that time the condition of Mother Pārvatī due to grief cannot even be described.

##### hāhākāra macyo kailāśā, śani kīnhoṃ lakhi suta ko nāśā .
##### turata garuḍ caḍhai viṣṇu sidhāyo, kāṭi cakra so gaja sira lāye .. 14 ..

After this, there was an outcry on Mount Kailash that Śani destroyed the son of Śiva-Pārvatī.

At the same time Lord Viṣṇu reached there riding on Garuḍa and brought the elephant's head cut off with his Sudarśana Cakra (a spinning, discus weapon).

##### bālaka ke dhaḍ ūpara dhārayo, prāṇa mantra paḍhai śaṃkara ḍārayo .
##### nāma "gaṇeśa" śambhu taba kīnhe, prathama pūjya buddhi nidhi vara dīnheṃ .. 15 ..

He placed this elephant head on the body of the child. After that Lord Śaṃkara recited the mantras and breathed life in it.

At the same time Lord Śaṃkara named you Gaṇeśa and gave a boon that you will be worshiped first in the world. The other gods also gave you many boons including the wealth of wisdom.

##### buddhi parīkṣā jaba śiva kīnhā, pṛthvī kara pradakṣiṇā līnhā .
##### cale ṣaḍānana, bharami bhulāī, race baiṭhi tuma buddhi upāī .. 16 ..

When Lord Śaṃkara tested Karthik and your intelligence, he told to go round the whole world.

As soon as the order was given, Karthik immediately set out to circumnavigate the whole earth without thinking, but you found the solution by using your intelligence.

##### caraṇa mātu-pitu ke dhara līnheṃ, tinake sāta pradakṣiṇa kīnheṃ .
##### dhani gaṇeśa kahi śiva hiye haraṣe, nabha te surana sumana bahu barase .. 17 ..

You touched the feet (as a gesture of expressing respect to elders) of your parents and made seven rounds around them.

In this way Lord Śiva was so pleased seeing your wisdom and faith. Seeing this, the gods started showering flowers from the sky.

##### tumharī mahimā buddhi baḍaāī, śeṣa sahasamukha sake na gāī .
##### maiṃ matihīna malīna dukhārī, karahuṃ kauna vidhi vinaya tumhārī .. 18 ..

O Lord Gaṇeśa you are great! even the thousand-headed serpent (Śeṣanāga) cannot praise your wisdom and glory.

O Lord, I am a man without intelligence, a sinner, and I am sad, in what way should I pray.

##### bhajata rāmasundara prabhudāsā, jaga prayāga kakarā durvāsā .
##### aba prabhu dayā dīnā para kījai, apanī bhakti śakti kucha dījai .. 19 ..

O Lord, your servant (devotee) Rāmsundara always remembers you. For them, Kakarā village of Prayāga is the whole world, where sages like Durvāsā were born.

Oh God! Now have mercy on the poor and sad people and please bless us with your devotion and your powers.

Glory to Hanumāna, the benefactor of saints. Please listen to our prayer. Do not delay in doing the work of your devotees. Please rush to do it and give us immense peace.

##### jaise kūdi sindhu vahi pārā . surasā badana paiṭhi vistārā ..

##### āge jāya laṃkinī rokā . mārehū lāta gaī sura lokā ..

(Please come running) just like when you leapt accross the ocean, entered and then emerged from the expanded mouth of Surasā (who tried to obstruct your path), and on landing in Lankā sent the demoness Lankinī to the heavenly abode by kicking her to death (when she tried to prevent you from entering the city).

##### jāya vibhīṣaṇa ko sukha dīnhā . sītā nirakhi parama pada līnhā ..

##### bāga ujāri sindhu maṃha borā . ati ātura yama kātara torā ..

In Lankā you gave pleasure to Vibhīṣaṇa (by meeting him) and attained the supreme position (of being loved by Śrī Rāma and then became the king of Lankā) due to Sītā’s merciful benediction. Then you laid waste the Ashoka grove and dumped the trees in the ocean, symbolically breaking the knife of Yama (the God of Death).

##### lāha samāna laṃka jari gaī . jai jai dhuni sura purama meṃ bhaī ..

You killed Akṣaya Kumāra (Rāvaṇa’s son) and burnt Lankā with your tail. Lankā burned like lac (molten wax) and the heavens were filled by the sound of "Hail to Hanumāna’s glory".

Hail to you, holder of the mountain! You are an ocean of happiness, wisest amongst gods and the most skillful. O you of indomitable spirit kill the enemies (lust, anger, greed…) as if they were nailed by the strike of a thunderbolt.

##### gadā bajra tai berihīṃ mārau . mahārāja nija dāsa ubāroṃ ..

##### suni haṃkāra huṃkāra dai dhāvo . bajra gadā hani vilamba na lāvo ..

O Lord! Relieve your servant by hitting the enemies with your mace as if it were a thunderbolt. Saying the thundering sound of OM, challenge the enemies and crush them with your mace.

##### satya hohu hari satya pāya kai . rāma duta dharū māru dhāī kai ..

O Hanumāna, Lord of the Monkeys, I invoke you with the Tantric mantra Oṁ hrīṃ hrīṃ hrīṃ and Oṁ huṃ huṃ huṃ. Strike the enemy in the chest and head. I swear by the name of Harī that all that I say is the truth. O messenger of Śrī Rāma, rush to attack the enemy at once.

##### pām̐ya parauṃ kara jori manāvauṃ . apane kāja lāgi guṇa gāvauṃ ..

Relying on your strength, I have no fear anywhere – whether in the forest, garden, mountains, on the road, or in the house. I fall at your feet and entreat you with folded hands (to help me). For whom else shall I call at this hour?

##### badana karāla danuja kula ghālaka . bhūta piśāca preta ura śālaka ..

Hail Hanumāna! All-powerful son of Aṃjanī and you are the incarnation of Śaṃkara himself. You have a fierce and terrifying body and are the slayer of even the agents of Yama (God of Death). You are always by the side of Śrī Rāma and are the benefactor of all.

I have come to take refuge at your feet. I plead with you; who else shall I call for help in this time of urgent need? Get up, get up, come along! I urge you with folded hands to swing into action.

##### oṃ haṃ haṃ hāṃka deta kapi caṃcala . oṃ saṃ saṃ sahami parāne khala dala ..

I implore you O nimble-footed Hanumāna with the call of Oṁ Caṃ Caṃ Caṃ Caṃ and Oṁ Hanu Hanu Hanu Hanu. Strike swiftly like lightning! O Hanumāna, you are swift. Whenever the monkeys roar, the crowd of evil-doers flee in terror.

##### apane jana ko kasa na ubārau . sumirata hota ānanda hamārau ..

##### tāte vinatī karauṃ pukārī . harahu sakala duḥkha vipati hamārī ..

O Lord, you are such an ocean of joy that your devotees rejoice as soon as they remember you, now get me out of the troubles soon. Oh Lord, I am calling you humbly and praying for the destruction of my sorrows.

##### rāma rūpa sarvatra samānā . dekhata rahata sadā harṣānā ..

Your glory is such that even the Śeṣā (thousand headed serpent) himself cannot describe your majesty even if they praise you for eternity. You have Ram embodied in you by visualising it you stay pleased and in bliss.

##### tuma sama nahīṃ jagata balavānā . kari vicāra dekhauṃ vidhi nānā ..

Goddess Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and sound) duly describes your qualities in different ways, but still not able to completely describe your greatness. O Lord, I have thought and searched in many ways, yet I have not seen any other being poweful and supreme like you.
